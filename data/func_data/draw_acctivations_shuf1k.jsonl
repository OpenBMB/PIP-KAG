{"question": "A democracy is a society ruled by the people. What name is given to a society ruled by the wealthy?", "answers": ["plutocracy"], "context": "America Is Ruled by Billionaires, and They Are Coming ...America Is Ruled by Billionaires, and They Are Coming After the Last Shreds of Our Democracy | Alternet \n America Is Ruled by Billionaires, and They Are Coming After the Last Shreds of Our Democracy \n America is a plutocracy through and through -- what are we going to do about it? \n Comments \n Plutocracy literally means rule by the rich. “Rule” can have various shades of meaning: those who exercise the authority of public office are wealthy; their wealth explains why they hold that office; they exercise that authority in the interests of the rich; they have the primary influence over who holds those offices and the actions they take. These aspects of “plutocracy” are not exclusive. Government of the rich and for the rich need not berun directly by the rich. Also, in some exceptional circumstances rich individuals who hold powerful positions may govern in the interests of the many, e.g. Franklin Roosevelt. \n The United States today qualifies as a plutocracy – on a number of grounds.  Let’s look at some striking bits of evidence. Gross income redistribution upwards in the hierarchy has been a feature of American society for the past decades. The familiar statistics tell us that nearly 80% of the national wealth generated since 1973 has gone to the upper 2%, 65% to the upper 1 per cent. Estimates as to the rise in real income for salaried workers over the past 40 years range from 20% to 28 %. In that period, real GDP has risen by 110% – it has more than doubled.  \n To put it somewhat differently, according to the Congressional Budget Office,  the top earning 1 percent of households gained about 8X more than those in the 60 percentile after federal taxes and income transfers over a period between 1979 and 2007; 10X those in lower percentiles.  In short, the overwhelming fraction of all the wealth created over two generations has gone to those at the very top of the income pyramid.  That pattern has been markedly accelerated since the financial crisis hit in 2008. Between 2000 and 2012, the real net worth of 90% of Americans has declined by 25%.  Theoretically, there is the possibility that this change is due to structural economic features operating nationally and internationally. That argument won’t wash, though, for three reasons. First, there is no reason to think that such a process has accelerated over the past five years during which disparities have widened at a faster rate. Second, other countries (many even more enmeshed in the world economy) have seen nothing like the drastic phenomenon occurring in the United States. Third, the readiness of the country’s political class to ignore what has been happening, and the absence of remedial action that could have been taken, in themselves are clear indicators of who shapes thinking and determines public policy. In addition, several significant governmental actions have been taken that directly favor the moneyed interests. \n The latter include the dismantling of the apparatus to regulate financial activities specifically and big business generally. Runaway exploitation of the system by predatory banks was made possible by the Clinton “reforms” of the 1990s and the lax application of those rules that still prevailed. Attorney General Eric Holder just a few weeks ago went so far as to admit that the Department of Justice’s decisions on when to bring criminal charges against the biggest financial institutions will depend not on the question of legal violations alone but would include the hypothetical effects on economic stability of their prosecution. Earlier, Holder had extended blanket immunity to Bank of America and other mortgage lenders for their apparent criminality in forging, robo-signing, foreclosure documents on millions of home owners. In brief, equal protection and application of the law has been suspended. That is plutocracy. \n Moreover, the extreme of a regulatory culture that, in effect, turns public officials into tame accessories to financial abuse emerged in stark relief at the Levin Committee hearings on J P Morgan Chase’s ‘London Whale” scandal. Morgan officials stated baldly that they chose not to inform the Controller of the Currency about discrepancies in trading accounts"}

Created by Mike Sekowsky. She was modified as Wonder Woman's younger sister when she was featured on the Wonder Woman Television series played by Debra Winger. \n Fictional character biographies \n Drusilla, was an Amazon messenger, then came to the former Wonder Woman with terrible news. \n In the dimension now hosting Paradise Island, Ares was attempting to force Hippolyta to give him the secret of transdimensional travel. \n Hippolyta kept refusing him, and Ares sent his troops against the Island, killing many Amazons. \n Ares’s daughter Eris then put Hippolyta into an enchanted sleep. \n A Time to Love a Time to Die! \n During Diana's adventures with I-Ching,  In another dimension, Queen Hippolyte tells an Amazon named Drusilla that she must bring Princess Diana back to her using a magic cross-dimensional amulet. Drusilla locates Diana and I-Ching, who then follow her, and brings them both across dimensional barriers to the land where Paradise Island now exists. \n Return to Paradise Island \n The land is ravaged by war, and Queen Hippolyte lies comatose and tormented. An Amazon reveals that Ares, his sister Eris, and his sons Diemos and Phobus came to Hippolyte and demanded the secret of dimensional travel so that they could travel to Earth and plunge it into bloody war. Hippolyte refused, and battle ensued, in which the Amazons were defeated. But Hippolyte still withheld the secret, whereupon Eris cursed her with a nightmare sleep that would only end when her secret was wrested from her. \n Now Mars appears to Diana and tells her that she can end her mother’s suffering by asking her to reveal the secret. But Hippolyte, even in sleep, grasps Diana’s hand, signifying her answer is still “No”. When Mars and his family attempt to kidnap Hippolyte, the Amazons surround their queen and prevent it. Mars withdraws, promising to return with troops. Diana rallies the Amazons to fight at her side against their foe, which outnumbers them five to one. Diana later dons battle armor and leads the Amazon army against Deimos’s and Phobus’s Beast Men, during which battle the enemy snatches Hippolyta. The Amazons recover their queen in a raid led by Diana, and they withdraw to a mountain pass where they intend to make their last stand against Mars’s troops. \n The Last Battle \n Diana hits on the idea of going to another dimension where King Arthur and heroes of legend still exist and asking for their help in repelling Mars’s troops. Drusilla, the Amazons’ messenger, takes her to that realm, in which Arthur is holding a tournament of heroes. But none of them wish to go to war again, even after Diana tells them Mars is on the march again. A fight begins between Diana and Siegfried, but the Valkyrie Brunhilde stops it and tells Diana she and her Valkyries would be proud to aid the Amazons. Thus, Diana returns with the Nordic war-women and begin their final engagement with Mars’s forces. Before long, they are joined by Roland and the other heroes from Arthur’s realm, and Mars’s army is defeated. Hippolyte awakens from her sleep, and Mars brings an unconscious Diana back to her, honoring his opponent, but telling her that he will eventually return. Roland, Brunnhilde, and all the other heroes and Valkyries depart. Paradise Island is rebuilt, and I-Ching opts to stay there awhile and study its ancient mysteries. With the crisis over, Drusilla takes Diana back to her apartment on Earth where they part ways and say their goodbyes. \n Alternate versions \n *A figure resembling Winger's Drusilla made a cameo appearance in Infinite Crisis #6, as the Wonder Girl of Earth-462. In other media \n Wonder Woman \n In 1976, a version of Wonder Girl (Drusilla instead of Donna Troy) appeared in the Wonder Woman television series and was played by Debra Winger. \n Although the pilot episode revealed that Wonder Woman's alter-ego, Princess Diana of Paradise Island, was Queen Hippolyta's only child"}

The rings of Saturn have fascinated stargazers for centuries, ever since telescopes were first pointed toward the sky. \n When Galileo Galilei first observed Saturn in 1610, he thought that the rings were enormous moons, one positioned on each side of the planet. Over several years of observations, he noted that the rings changed shape and even disappeared , as they changed their inclination with respect to Earth. \n We now know that Galileo was observing a \"ring plane crossing.\" Saturn's equator is tilted relative to its orbit around the sun by 27 degrees – similar to Earth's 23-degree tilt. As Saturn circles the sun, first one hemisphere and then the other is tilted sunward. The tilt causes seasons, just as it does on Earth, and when Saturn reaches equinox, its equator and ring plane are directly in line with the sun. Sunlight hits the rings edge-on, and the fine line of the rings is difficult to detect. The rings are wide — 170,000 miles across (273,600 km) — but only about 30 feet (10 meters) thick. \n In 1655, astronomer Christaan Huygens suggested that the strange bodies were solid, inclined rings, and in 1660 another astronomer suggested that the rings were made up of small satellites, an insight that wasn't confirmed for nearly 200 years. \n In modern times, Pioneer 11 passed through the Saturn ring plane in 1979. In the 1980s, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 glimpsed the planet's ring system. \n In 2004, NASA's Cassini-Huygens mission became the first to enter orbit around Saturn, taking detailed observations not only of the planet but of its ring system. \n Details of Saturn's icy rings are visible in this sweeping view from Cassini of the planet's glorious ring system. The total span, from A ring to F ring, covers approximately 40,800 miles (65,700 km) and was photographed at Nov. 26, 2008. \n Credit: NASA/JPL/Space Science Institute \n Composition and structure \n Saturn's rings are made up of billions of particles ranging from grains of sand to mountain-size chunks. Composed predominantly of water-ice, the rings also draw in rocky meteoroids as they travel through space. \n Though Saturn appears surrounded by a single, solid ring when viewed by an amateur astronomer, several divisions exist. The rings are named alphabetically in the order of discovery. Thus the main rings are, from farthest from the planet to closest, A, B and C. A gap 2,920 miles wide (4,700 kilometers), known as the Cassini Division, separates the A and B rings. \n Other, fainter rings have been discovered as telescope technology has improved. Voyager 1 detected the innermost D ring in 1980. The F ring lies just outside of the A ring, while the G and E ring lay even farther out. \n The rings themselves contain a number of gaps and structures . Some are created by Saturn's many small moons, while others continue to puzzle to astronomers. \n Saturn is not the only planet in the solar system to have rings — Jupiter , Uranus and Neptune also contain faint ring systems — but with its satellites spanning three-quarters of the Earth-moon distance (175,000 miles or 282,000 km), it is by far the largest and most visible. \n Formation theories \n Several hypotheses exist as to the how Saturn's rings were formed. Some scientists think that passing comets or asteroids were snagged by the planet's gravity and broken up before reaching it. \n Another possibility is that the rings were once"}

Carolina got off to another strong start after the kickoff, with Newton completing a 42-yard pass to Corey Brown. But once again they came up empty, this time as a result of a Newton pass that bounced off the hands of Ginn and was intercepted by safety T. J. Ward. Ward fumbled the ball during the return, but Trevathan recovered it to enable Denver to keep possession."}

Broadcaster and writer Stuart Maconie described Newcastle as England's best-looking city and the late German-born British scholar of architecture, Nikolaus Pevsner, describes Grey Street as one of the finest streets in England. The street curves down from Grey's Monument towards the valley of the River Tyne and was voted England's finest street in 2005 in a survey of BBC Radio 4 listeners. In the Google Street View awards of 2010, Grey Street came 3rd in the British picturesque category. Osborne Road came 4th in the foodie street category.

As it spread to western Europe, the disease entered the region from southern Russia also. By autumn 1347, the plague reached Alexandria in Egypt, probably through the port's trade with Constantinople, and ports on the Black Sea. During 1347, the disease travelled eastward to Gaza, and north along the eastern coast to cities in Lebanon, Syria and Palestine, including Ashkelon, Acre, Jerusalem, Sidon, Damascus, Homs, and Aleppo. In 1348–49, the disease reached Antioch. The city's residents fled to the north, most of them dying during the journey, but the infection had been spread to the people of Asia Minor.[citation needed]"}

Smith was brought to a local hospital in serious condition, officials said\n\n\n\nAt 7 p.m. Wednesday Smith died at Parkland Hospital, the medical examiner's office said. An autopsy is slated for Thursday.\n\n\n\nTwo people were killed in the shootings along a three-mile stretch on and near the LBJ Freeway, about 10 miles northeast of downtown Dallas.\n\n\n\nPolice used ballistic tests to link Smith, a 12-year veteran of the Utah state police, to three of the four shootings, Dallas Police Lt. Craig Miller said Tuesday.\n\n\n\nMiller said Smith was a suspect in both nonfatal shootings and one of the fatal shootings. He said it was unclear if Smith was a suspect in the fatal shooting that occurred first.\n\n\n\nThe first attack occurred in the city of Garland at about 5:41 p.m. Victim Jorge Lopez, 20, was sitting in his Nissan at a traffic light in Garland when a man in a pickup pulled alongside him and fired shots into his car, killing him, Officer Joe Harn of the Garland police said.\n\n\n\nA few minutes later and two miles away on the LBJ Freeway, a gunman fired at two tractor-trailers.\n\n\n\nWhile one driver escaped injuries, William Scott Miller, 42, of Frankfort, Kentucky, was shot to death behind the wheel of a United Van Lines truck, police said.\n\n\n\n\"He was going to be traveling home,\" Lt. Miller said. \"He was about to park his rig. He was going to get on a plane to fly to be with his wife and children for the Christmas season and then come back to this location.\"\n\n\n\nMiller called the truck driver a hero because he was able to control his rig before he died -- preventing other motorists from being hurt.\n\n\n\nThe fourth attack came a mile west on LBJ Freeway, where gunfire shattered the windshield of another tractor-trailer. The bullets missed the driver, but flying glass caused minor cuts, police said.\n\n\n\nSmith, 37, left his trooper job in Utah after he was caught abusing alcohol and drugs, CNN affiliate WFAA reported, citing an official report. The sergeant began using drugs and alcohol after his patrol car was rear-ended while he was writing a ticket, according to the report by Utah Peace Officers Standards and Training.\n\n\n\nHe moved to Texas shortly afterward, the station said.\n\n\n\nHarn told WFAA that Smith's wife had phoned police Monday to say her husband was suicidal and driving around with a gun. Police were able to locate him using cell phone transmission towers. A three-hour stand-off followed, ending when Smith shot himself in the head, Harn said."}

If the name 'Rihanna' had been mentioned, well, no disrespect, but it wouldn't have meant anything.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, he says that when he went to get his tractor Monday and saw the singer stripping down to a bikini top, he stepped in to end the shoot.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe local political representative said he \"asked the film crew to stop, and they did.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGraham insisted that \"there were no hard feelings.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe added: \"I had a conversation with Rihanna; we shook hands; we parted company on good terms. I found her very gracious, and I hope she understands where I'm coming from. I wish her well.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWord had quickly spread of Rihanna's surprise appearance in the Northern Irish countryside, and traffic came to a standstill as fans attempted to catch a glimpse of the star.\n\n\n\n\n\nGraham's wife shed more light on the incident Tuesday, revealing that Rihanna had gone topless.\n\n\n\n\n\nSaid Mrs. Graham, who declined to give her first name, \"What she was doing became more inappropriate. When she started to go topless, that's what Alan was particularly objecting to -- things were getting out of hand. There was a man as well, and the behavior was getting more inappropriate. ...

Some contain pyrenoids. Rhodoplasts have chlorophyll a and phycobilins for photosynthetic pigments; the phycobilin phycoerytherin is responsible for giving many red algae their distinctive red color. However, since they also contain the blue-green chlorophyll a and other pigments, many are reddish to purple from the combination. The red phycoerytherin pigment is an adaptation to help red algae catch more sunlight in deep water—as such, some red algae that live in shallow water have less phycoerytherin in their rhodoplasts, and can appear more greenish. Rhodoplasts synthesize a form of starch called floridean, which collects into granules outside the rhodoplast, in the cytoplasm of the red alga."}

{"question": "Who painted 'Gypsy Girl' found in the Louvre, Paris?", "answers": ["frans hals", "franz hals"], "context": "Frans Hals, Louvre - Travel To EatFrans Hals, Louvre - Travel To Eat \n Travel To Eat \n Frans Hals, Louvre \n Bohemian. Frans Hals, Louvre \n ‘Gypsy Girl’ (also known as ‘Bohemian’) is an oil painting on wood created by Frans Hals in approximately 1628-1630. It depicts a young gypsy wench who appears to be slightly leaning her right arm on a table or counter, and bears a sly and somewhat mischievous smile on her face. Each brush stroke has been exquisitely executed as to create a particular elegance to her burly physique. She seems to be facing a window that illuminates her face, drawing the viewer’s attention to her voluptuous breasts. She dons a red overdress, with a low-cut white shirt underneath. Hals well-known portraiture talents are most apparent in ‘Gypsy Girl’ as he masterfully contrasts her hardened street-smart appearance with the soft, natural beauty of her inner self. She seems happy with her life. \n Hals was a master of a technique that utilized something previously seen as a flaw in painting, the visible brushstroke. The soft curling lines of Hals' brush are always clear upon the surface: “materially just lying there, flat, while conjuring substance and space in the eye.” Hals was fond of daylight and silvery sheen, while Rembrandt used golden glow effects based upon artificial contrasts of low light in immeasurable gloom. Both men were painters of touch, but of touch on different keys — Rembrandt was the bass, Hals the treble. \n Buffoon Playing a Lute. Frans Hals, Louvre \n In the painting seen above from the Louvre, “Buffoon Playing a Lute” from 1623-1624, you can see the same mischievous energy seen in Gypsy Girl. A wide, perhaps ironic smile lights up the whole of the lutist's face, giving it enormous life. The natural spontaneity that the picture exudes is undoubtedly due to the fact that the artist studied a real man, the same model who is found in several other of his pictures. However, this is not strictly speaking a portrait, although Hals became famous for these too. Portrait commissions were restricted to the upper classes of society-the nobility, the middle classes, or perhaps men of letters who had themselves painted in conventional, rather static poses. \n Officers of the Saint Georges Civic Guard, Haarlem. Fran's Hals Museum, Haarlem, The Netherlands \n By the 1620s Hals had definitively evolved a technique that was close to impressionism in its looseness. Like the contemporary Spanish painter Diego Velázquez, he used colour to structure forms; and this use of colour is what sets the two artists apart from their contemporaries. Unique to Hals, however, is his use of quick, loose strokes of bright colour that suggest rather than enclose form and are highly expressive of movement and of the subjects' vitality. Most painters of the 17th century approached their paintings slowly, with preparatory drawings, a certain amount of underpainting, and an elaborate finish. Although there is no certain evidence of his method, Hals seems to have started directly on the canvas and painted quickly, leaving his first spontaneous expression, which is almost an oil sketch, as the finished work. Hals continued to use this technique, which gave a striking immediacy to his perceptive portrayals of character, all his life, painting with increasing freedom as he grew older. In his group portraits, such as The Banquet of the Officers of the St Adrian Militia Company in 1627, Hals captures each character in a different manner. The faces are not idealized and are clearly distinguishable, with their personalities revealed in a variety of poses and facial expressions. \n Portrait of René Descartes by Frans Hals 1649. Statens Museum for Kunst, Copenhagen \n Portrait of René Descartes after Frans Hals 1650-1700. Louvre, Paris. \n As early as the 17th century, people were struck by the vitality of Frans Hals' portraits. For example, Haarlem resident Theodorus Schrevelius noted that Hals' works reflected “such power and life” that the painter “seems to challenge nature with his brush”. His most noted portrait today is the one he made in"}

{"question": "Which craft uses paper cut-outs and varnished to various surfaces?", "answers": ["decoupage"], "context": "Free Decoupage Instructions and Ideas! - CraftsFree Decoupage Instructions and Ideas! \n Tweet \n History \n Decoupage is an easy craft and produces such delightful results that you will want to continue creating wonderful new projects, again and again.  The art of Decoupage is basically cutting out pictures and pasting them on furniture or home accessories to simulate painting.  This art form  was also known as “poor man’s art” because in the olden days those who couldn’t afford to hire an artist to decorate their furniture could obtain quite elegant effects with cut-outs pasted on and covered with multiple coats of varnish or lacquer.  \n Decoupage flourished in Europe during the 18th and 19th centuries.  Many elaborate decorations on boxes, trays, chests and tables, formerly believed to have been hand painted, and were later found to be merely cut-outs cleverly applied by a crafty artisan.  \n There are three ways of performing this art form and each has its own name.  Decoupage is an original arrangement of cut-outs or paste-ons used on pictures, murals, furniture and accessories to simulate painting.  Montage is a mounting of materials that may or may not be cut-outs or paste-ons.  Photographs, travel folders, handbills or old postcards might be artistically arranged on a screen or mural and varnished or lacquered.  Collage uses various items such as bits of string, wood, shells or romantic keepsakes in a shadowbox type of arrangement.  It is often very difficult to decide which of these three designations applies to the finished composition.  Usually the word decoupage is used to incorporate all three methods.  \n Materials \n Excellent materials for decoupage include Seed catalogues, magazines, old books, wallpaper, gift wrappings, scrapbook paper, foil-covered paper, lace paper doilies (they come in a variety of colors such as gold and silver), posters, travel folders, Valentines and greeting cards.  Many materials can be found in art supply stores, thrift and antique shops, bookstores, auctions, attics, garage sales and just about anywhere you can find items to re-purpose.  \n For making collage or shadow box arrangements try adding beads, sequins, shells, feathers, fans and any other fun small, memorable accents you have at hand.  These items may also be purchased at craft stores, antique dealers and thrift shops. \n Art supply stores and importers carry decorative papers for lining boxes, drawers, desks and covering telephone books, albums and screens.  They may also carry gold-foil medallions, corners, frames, leaves, stars, bells, and other small items for decorating trays, boxes, book covers, picture frames and other accessories.  Tiny floral bouquets, as found on vintage Valentines, make stunning designs for small articles.  Gold edging placed on a box, picture or tray will enhance its beauty and give and elegant, professional touch.   \n Instructions \n With a sharp pair of scissors and good eyesight, anyone with a fair sense of composition and a feeling for color can do professional looking decoupage work.  As you cut out designs from decorative papers, prints or magazines, the scissors should be tilted slightly toward the right to obtain a beveled edge.  A straight up-and-down cut will result in a hard, raw edge which may show the color of the underside of the print.  Razor blades, X-acto knives, straight and curved scissors are all held in this manner, slanted as you cut. \n When pasting, lay work face down on a large sheet of glass or marble topped table.  Some people prefer to use wallpaper paste for large areas, but any of the modern water-soluble pastes, decoupage mediums or glues are effective.  These adhesives may be used at full strength, except on glass where they should be diluted.  Lay the work face down, dip a brush in water, then in paste.  Brush paste on smoothly, working from the center to the edges.  It is important to be sure there is enough paste.  For large areas, after"}
{"question": "What events are often associated with volcanism and igneous activity?", "answers": ["Deformational events", "Deformational", "Deformational"], "context": "The addition of new rock units, both depositionally and intrusively, often occurs during deformation. Faulting and other deformational processes result in the creation of topographic gradients, causing material on the rock unit that is increasing in elevation to be eroded by hillslopes and channels. These sediments are deposited on the rock unit that is going down. Continual motion along the fault maintains the topographic gradient in spite of the movement of sediment, and continues to create accommodation space for the material to deposit. Deformational events are often also associated with volcanism and igneous activity. Volcanic ashes and lavas accumulate on the surface, and igneous intrusions enter from below. Dikes, long, planar igneous intrusions, enter along cracks, and therefore often form in large numbers in areas that are being actively deformed. This can result in the emplacement of dike swarms, such as those that are observable across the Canadian shield, or rings of dikes around the lava tube of a volcano."}

He wants to begin the process of making amends, and that's what he's going to discuss.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBlog: No apologies Tiger, just be real\n\n\n\n\n\nSteinberg said he didn't know if Woods' wife, Elin Nordegren, would appear with her husband.\n\n\n\n\n\nWoods crashed his black Cadillac Escalade into a fire hydrant and then a tree just a few days after the National Enquirer reported he was having an affair with a New York nightclub hostess who denied the affair.\n\n\n\n\n\nA day after he paid his $164 traffic ticket, Woods' seemingly perfect world began to crumble under what would eventually become an avalanche of allegations of infidelity threatening his five-year marriage to Nordegren.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe couple have two children, Charlie, 1, and Sam, 2.\n\n\n\n\n\nWoods issued an apology for \"transgressions\" that had let his family down, as several women reported they had affairs with the golfer -- including one woman who allegedly had Woods on a voicemail asking her to take his name off her cell phone because \"my wife went through my phone and may be calling you.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral of Woods' major sponsors, including AT&T and Accenture, ended their business relationships with Woods following the crash and the exposure of his marriage troubles.\n\n\n\n\n\niReport: Share your thoughts on Woods' apology\n\n\n\n\n\nBut other companies, including Nike and Pepsi's Gatorade, continue to sponsor Woods, who has taken a break from his professional golfing career.

{"question": "In June 1978, who became the first cricketer to score a century and take eight wickets in one inning in a Test Match?", "answers": ["ian botham"], "context": "1978: Botham bowls into cricket history - BBC NewsBBC ON THIS DAY | 19 | 1978: Botham bowls into cricket history \n Search ON THIS DAY by date \n   \n About This Site | Text Only \n 1978: Botham bowls into cricket history \n Cricketing star Ian Botham has become the first man in the history of the game to score a century and take eight wickets in one innings of a Test match. \n The Somerset all-rounder's blistering performance helped bring England victory by an innings and 120 runs in the second Cornhill Test. \n He hit 108 runs in England's first innings and today took eight wickets for just 34 runs to contribute to Pakistan's second innings total of all out for 139. \n In fact, Tony Greig is the only other England player to score a century and take more than five wickets in an innings. He hit 143 runs and took six wickets for 164 against the West Indies at Bridgetown, Barbados, in 1974. \n Botham was just unplayable \n Pakistan captain Wasim Bari \n England captain Mike Brearley said of Botham's performance: \"He is colossus at the moment.\" \n Botham made his Test debut at the age of 21 against Australia at Trent Bridge, Nottingham, in July last year. \n In that match, he took five wickets for 74 runs to help bowl out the opposition for 243. His wife Kathryn, who was eight months pregnant with the couple's first child, was in the spectator stands. \n Today at Trent Bridge, it was Botham's swinging deliveries which managed to beat his Pakistani opponents. \n Afterwards, Pakistan captain Wasim Bari said: \"I have never seen a ball swing so much in bright weather...Botham was just unplayable.\" \n The Pakistan team includes many players new to Test cricket and unused to English weather conditions. \n Bari continued: \"England bowled better, batted better and fielded better than we did. And this man Botham is a magnificent cricketer.\" \n In Context \n Ian Botham went on to become one of England's greatest ever all-rounders. \n Perhaps his best performance was in the 1981 Ashes series against Australia. After a poor run of results ending with a draw in the second Test, he resigned the England captaincy. \n England were one down and facing almost certain defeat in the third Test at Headingley. Botham saved the match, England ended up winning the series three-one, and the all-rounder's legendary status was assured. \n He played in 102 Test matches in a career spanning from 1977-92. His highest-ever batting score was 208 - his best performance with the ball was eight wickets for 34 runs. \n Since retiring from the game, he has become a television commentator and in 2003 became an adviser to his old county team of Somerset. \n He has also walked thousands of miles raising money for Leukaemia Research and more recently for The Noah's Ark appeal  which is building a children's hospital in Wales. \n His son, Liam, played county cricket for Hampshire in 1996 but has since taken up professional rugby. \n Stories From 19 Jun  20 Facts: The Year 1978 - Running Wolf's Rant20 Facts: The Year 1978 \n 20 Facts: The Year 1978 \n by Henno Kruger · January 12, 2010 \n It’s hard to believe that 32 years have passed since the year 1978. I was one year old back then, so I do not have much recollection of this period in my mind. But this doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t explore the notable events of this year. This post sums up 20 Facts from the year 1978. History is one of my interests. How do we know where we are going if we don’t know where we are coming from? History has a tendency to repeat itself. Hopefully the human race can learn from past mistakes. I must admit that 1978 is not that long ago if you look at the big historical picture, though. It was an interesting year and worthy of being featured on Running Wolf’s Rant. For those of you who were alive back then: Hope you enjoy this trip down memory lane"}

{"question": "How many avulsions have occurred in the past 6000 yeas?", "answers": ["80", "80", "80"], "context": "Since ~3000 yr BP (= years Before Present), human impact is seen in the delta. As a result of increasing land clearance (Bronze Age agriculture), in the upland areas (central Germany), the sediment load of the Rhine has strongly increased and delta growth has sped up. This caused increased flooding and sedimentation, ending peat formation in the delta. The shifting of river channels to new locations, on the floodplain (termed avulsion), was the main process distributing sediment across the subrecent delta. Over the past 6000 years, approximately 80 avulsions have occurred. Direct human impact in the delta started with peat mining, for salt and fuel, from Roman times onward. This was followed by embankment, of the major distributaries and damming of minor distributaries, which took place in the 11–13th century AD. Thereafter, canals were dug, bends were short cut and groynes were built, to prevent the river's channels from migrating or silting up."}
{"question": "What was the reaction in Seoul?", "answers": ["astonishment"], "context": "(CNN) -- It was just after midday on a cold December Monday in South Korea's capital when news of Kim Jong Il's death filtered through.\n\n\n\n\n\nThough the reclusive North Korean leader had been plagued with health problems in recent years, the announcement was greeted with general astonishment in Seoul, according to a journalist from the country's largest newspaper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The initial reaction was shock, quickly followed by speculation about what was going to happen next,\" said Woosuk Ken Choi, assistant editor with The Chosun Daily.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor its part, the South Korean military responded by raising its alert level, while the country's media went into overdrive trying to predict how this oblique and erratic state would respond.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Choi said most ordinary Koreans were remaining calm.\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Korea: Should we fear change?\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There was no rush to supermarkets to buy up food,\" he said in an interview with CNN. \"The South Korean public seems confident that the country will be able to manage this. Many see the North Koreans as like us, people we need to care for and help.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOutright conflict is not something many would expect, he added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There is a little tradition in Korea that when someone passes away in a family you stop fighting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're on high alert not because we want to do something but because some renegade North Korean unit might cause some trouble. But no one really thinks the North Koreans will launch an attack.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Nothing happened in 1994 when Kim Il Sung died and it will be the same this time.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe architect of what became known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in 1948 after the Korean peninsula was divided between U.S. and Soviet occupation forces, Kim Il Sung was an autocratic leader who presided over a policy of Juche, or self-reliance, which did much to foster the Communist country's isolation.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Kim Jong Il, his oldest son, succeeded him, North Korea was crippled economically, having lost one of its main trading partners when the Soviet Union collapsed. Kim largely ignored the massive problems at home and focused on shoring up the regime's position and investing in the military as a bulwark against the wealthy, U.S.-backed south.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat military hardware does North Korea have?\n\n\n\n\n\nBut with Kim dead, Choi believes many in the south will see this as an opportunity to improve relations with their dysfunctional neighbor, perhaps even paving the way for reunification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Most people, whether left or right on the political spectrum, hope this is the case,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"However a large chunk of South Koreans do worry about the financial burden of reunification, citing the case of West and East Germany in the early 1990s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Others argue the cost of living together will be a lot less than living separately in the long run. I also believe a whole host of issues could be resolved with reunification.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Choi said each generation in South Korea has its own viewpoint when it comes to relations with the north.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Those in their teens and 20s have a real fear of military conflict, as they are the ones who have to complete their compulsory military service,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Many people in their 30s and 40s worry about the financial cost to them of reunification, while those in their 50s and 60s back a united Korea whatever the cost.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIf reunification is a pipe dream for now, Choi says there is a difference of opinion in South Korea about the dynastic succession in the north.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Many people believe the transfer of power to a third generation is absurd, totally anachronistic and not what the world is about today,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But those who believe in a policy of engagement with North Korea say it doesn't matter whether it is third or fourth generation, they're still our people and we need to talk to them to try and resolve the situation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother view, according to Choi, is \"the Great Successor\" will not last long.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He's simply too young,\" he said.

{"question": "What was the name of the 1991 Doctor Who exhibition?", "answers": ["Behind the Sofa", "Behind the Sofa", "Behind the Sofa"], "context": "The phrase \"Hiding behind (or 'watching from behind') the sofa\" entered British pop culture, signifying in humour the stereotypical early-series behaviour of children who wanted to avoid seeing frightening parts of a television programme while remaining in the room to watch the remainder of it. The phrase retains this association with Doctor Who, to the point that in 1991 the Museum of the Moving Image in London named their exhibition celebrating the programme \"Behind the Sofa\". The electronic theme music too was perceived as eerie, novel, and frightening, at the time.

Kennedy, the first episode of Doctor Who was repeated with the second episode the following week. Doctor Who has always appeared initially on the BBC's mainstream BBC One channel, where it is regarded as a family show, drawing audiences of many millions of viewers; episodes are now repeated on BBC Three. The programme's popularity has waxed and waned over the decades, with three notable periods of high ratings. The first of these was the \"Dalekmania\" period (circa 1964–1965), when the popularity of the Daleks regularly brought Doctor Who ratings of between 9 and 14 million, even for stories which did not feature them. The second was the late 1970s, when Tom Baker occasionally drew audiences of over 12 million."}
{"question": "Turtles and jellyfish can eat large quantities of what?", "answers": ["ctenophores,", "ctenophores", "ctenophores"], "context": "Ctenophores used to be regarded as \"dead ends\" in marine food chains because it was thought their low ratio of organic matter to salt and water made them a poor diet for other animals. It is also often difficult to identify the remains of ctenophores in the guts of possible predators, although the combs sometimes remain intact long enough to provide a clue. Detailed investigation of chum salmon, Oncorhynchus keta, showed that these fish digest ctenophores 20 times as fast as an equal weight of shrimps, and that ctenophores can provide a good diet if there are enough of them around. Beroids prey mainly on other ctenophores. Some jellyfish and turtles eat large quantities of ctenophores, and jellyfish may temporarily wipe out ctenophore populations. Since ctenophores and jellyfish often have large seasonal variations in population, most fish that prey on them are generalists, and may have a greater effect on populations than the specialist jelly-eaters. This is underlined by an observation of herbivorous fishes deliberately feeding on gelatinous zooplankton during blooms in the Red Sea. The larvae of some sea anemones are parasites on ctenophores, as are the larvae of some flatworms that parasitize fish when they reach adulthood."}

This changed the understanding of geologic time. Previously, geologists could only use fossils and stratigraphic correlation to date sections of rock relative to one another. With isotopic dates it became possible to assign absolute ages to rock units, and these absolute dates could be applied to fossil sequences in which there was datable material, converting the old relative ages into new absolute ages."}

Traditionally consultant pharmacists were usually independent business owners, though in the United States many now work for several large pharmacy management companies (primarily Omnicare, Kindred Healthcare and PharMerica). This trend may be gradually reversing as consultant pharmacists begin to work directly with patients, primarily because many elderly people are now taking numerous medications but continue to live outside of institutional settings.

{"question": "Who is the current Australian prime minister ?", "answers": ["julia gillard"], "context": "Prime Minister of AustraliaThe Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia is the head of government in Australia. The individual who holds the office is the most senior Minister of the Crown, the leader of the Cabinet and the chairperson of the National Security Committee. The office is not mentioned in the Constitution of Australia and exists only through an unwritten political convention and tradition. Despite this, in practice it is the most powerful political position in Australia. The individual who holds the office is commissioned by the Governor-General of Australia. \n Almost always and according to convention, the Prime Minister is the leader of the majority party or largest party in a coalition of parties in the House of Representatives. However, there is no constitutional requirement that the prime minister sit in the House of Representatives, or even be a member of parliament, though by convention this is always the case. The only case where a member of the Senate was appointed prime minister was John Gorton, who subsequently resigned his Senate position and was elected as a member of the House of Representatives (Senator George Pearce was acting prime minister for seven months in 1916 while Billy Hughes was overseas).  \n Malcolm Turnbull has held the office of Prime Minister since 15 September 2015. He received his commission after replacing Tony Abbott as the leader of the Liberal Party, the dominant party in the Coalition government, following the outcome of the September 2015 Liberal leadership ballot.  \n Former Prime Ministers continue to be important national figures, and in some cases go on to significant post-prime ministerial careers. Some notable examples have included: Edmund Barton, who was a justice of the High Court; George Reid, Andrew Fisher, Joseph Cook and Stanley Bruce, who were High Commissioners to the United Kingdom; Arthur Fadden, who was Treasurer under another prime minister, Robert Menzies; and Kevin Rudd, who became Julia Gillard's Foreign Minister. \n Appointment \n The Prime Minister of Australia is appointed by the Governor-General of Australia under Section 64 of the Australian Constitution, which empowers the Governor-General to appoint Ministers of the Crown and requires such Ministers to be members of the House of Representatives or the Senate, or become members within three months of the appointment. Before being sworn in as a minister, a person must first be sworn in as a member of the Federal Executive Council if they are not already a member. Membership of the Federal Executive Council entitles the member to the style of The Honourable (usually abbreviated to The Hon) for life, barring exceptional circumstances. The senior members of the Executive Council constitute the Cabinet of Australia. \n The Prime Minister is, like other ministers, normally sworn in by the Governor-General and then presented with the commission (Letters patent) of office. When defeated in an election, or on resigning, the Prime Minister is said to \"hand in the commission\" and actually does so by returning it to the Governor-General. In the event of a Prime Minister dying in office, or becoming incapacitated, the Governor-General can terminate the commission. Ministers hold office \"during the pleasure of the Governor-General\" (s. 64 of the Constitution of Australia), so theoretically, the Governor-General can dismiss a minister at any time, by notifying them in writing of the termination of their commission; however, his or her power to do so except on the advice of the Prime Minister is heavily circumscribed by convention. \n Despite the importance of the office of prime minister, the Constitution does not mention the office by name. The conventions of the Westminster system were thought to be sufficiently entrenched in Australia by the authors of the Constitution that it was deemed unnecessary to detail them. The formal title of the portfolio has always been simply \"Prime Minister\", except for the period of the Fourth Deakin Ministry (June 1909 to April 1910), when it was known as \"Prime Minister (without portfolio)\".  \n If a government cannot get its appropriation (budget) legislation passed by the House of Representatives, or the House passes a vote of \"no confidence\" in the government, the Prime Minister is"}

In 1830, the Methodist Protestant Church split from the Methodist Episcopal Church over the issue of laity having a voice and vote in the administration of the church, insisting that clergy should not be the only ones to have any determination in how the church was to be operated.

{"question": "Why is the node requiered to look up", "answers": ["Routing a packet requires the node to look up the connection id in a table", "the connection id in a table", "connection id"], "context": "Connection-oriented transmission requires a setup phase in each involved node before any packet is transferred to establish the parameters of communication. The packets include a connection identifier rather than address information and are negotiated between endpoints so that they are delivered in order and with error checking. Address information is only transferred to each node during the connection set-up phase, when the route to the destination is discovered and an entry is added to the switching table in each network node through which the connection passes. The signaling protocols used allow the application to specify its requirements and discover link parameters. Acceptable values for service parameters may be negotiated. Routing a packet requires the node to look up the connection id in a table. The packet header can be small, as it only needs to contain this code and any information, such as length, timestamp, or sequence number, which is different for different packets."}

{"question": "Who is the current presenter of BBC Radio 4 programme Desert Island Discs?", "answers": ["kirsty young"], "context": "BBC Radio 4 - Desert Island Discs - The History of Desert ...BBC Radio 4 - Desert Island Discs - The History of Desert Island Discs \n Read more about sharing. \n The History of Desert Island Discs \n Late one evening in 1941, freelance broadcaster Roy Plomley was at his home and already in his pyjamas, when an idea came to him. He sat down and wrote immediately to the BBC. That letter reached the in-tray of the BBC’s Head of Popular Record Programmes, Leslie Perowne. The pitch was successful and a broadcasting institution was born. \n That first Desert Island Discs was recorded in the BBC’s bomb-damaged Maida Vale studio on 27th January 1942 and aired in the Forces Programme at 8pm two days later. It was introduced to the listening public as \"a programme in which a well-known person is asked the question, if you were to be cast away alone on a desert island, which eight gramophone records would you choose to have with you, assuming of course, that you had a gramophone and an inexhaustible supply of needles\". \n Plomley’s first castaway was the popular Viennese comedian, actor and musician, Vic Oliver. The first piece of music chosen by Vic Oliver, and therefore by any castaway, was Chopin’s Étude No.12 in C minor played by pianist Alfred Cortot. During these war years, every BBC Radio show was scripted and Plomley and his guests would 'read' their conversations. On 7th May 1942 Roy Plomley made his first appearance as a castaway when the programme was presented by Leslie Perowne. \n The programme came off air in 1946 returning to the Home Service in 1951. On 16th September that year, the choice of luxury was introduced when garlic was chosen by the actress Sally Ann Howes. The choice of book made its first appearance on 9th October 1951 when actor and director Henry Kendall chose Who’s Who in the Theatre. According to Roy Plomley’s book, Desert Island Lists, in addition to the volume of Shakespeare, the castaways would be given a copy of the Bible, which was assumed to have been deposited there by The Gideon Society. \n In September 1967, Desert Island Discs transferred to the newly created Radio 4 service. Roy Plomley continued to present the programme until his death, from pleurisy, in May 1985. He was 71. He was replaced by Michael Parkinson who dispensed with the ritual of the pre-recording lunch at Plomley’s club, the Garrick, and insisted that the music was played to the guests during the recording rather than edited in afterwards. Parkinson presented the last of his 96 programmes on 13th March 1988, when his guest was the athlete Brendan Foster. \n Sue Lawley became the first female presenter and over the following 18 years, Lawley, a former Nationwide presenter, interviewed 750 people from all aspects of public life including politics, entertainment, science and sport. Describing the role as “one of the best jobs in broadcasting”, Lawley left Desert Island Discs in August 2006 and was replaced by journalist and broadcaster, Kirsty Young. During her tenure in the chair the programme has become available to listen again online and is available as a download.

Although he also wrote plays, and presented other programmes such as One Minute, Please, he will be forever associated with Desert Island Discs.

California Milk Processor Board \n New research reveals that, contrary to popular belief, brand   slogans don't need to be short in order for people to like them. \n According to the study, published in the Journal of Business Research , there are   three primary factors that determine whether people like a given   slogan: \n Clarity of message \n Creativity \n Familiarity with the brand \n What's fascinating is the study found that while repeated   exposure can help people remember a slogan better, people are   unlikely to have a more positive reaction to it simply because   they have seen it more frequently. \n Creating a jingle around a slogan, like McDonald's \"I'm Lovin'   It,\" does not have an effect on whether people will like it, the   study found. \n Here are some other factors the researchers tested. Note that   stating a product benefit and making sure the tagline is   appropriate for the advertised product can make a slogan more   likable: \n Journal of Business   Research \n In order to get their data, the researchers surveyed 595 people   about 150 well-known slogans, asking them questions about whether   they liked the slogans and to rate them on qualities like clarity   and simplicity. \n The researchers also published a list of the ten most-liked   slogans and the 10 most-remembered slogans. \n Four slogans appeared on both lists: \"Melts in your mouth, not in   your hands\" (M&M's), \"Eat fresh\" (Subway), \"Got milk?\"   (California Milk Processor Board), and \"Think outside the   bun\" (Taco Bell). \n Here are the most liked slogans. These tend to be   taglines for major brands that consumers feel are both clear and   creative. \n 1. \"Melts in your mouth, not in your hand\" (M&M's) \n 2. \"The few, the proud, the marines\" (U.S. Marine Corps) \n 3. \"What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas\" (Las Vegas) \n 4. \"The happiest place on the earth\" (Disneyland) \n 5. \"Easy breezy beautiful cover girl\" (CoverGirl) \n 6. \"Eat fresh\" (Subway) \n 7. \"Red Bull gives you wings\" (Red Bull) \n 8. \"Think outside the bun\" (Taco Bell) \n 9. \"Got milk?\" (California Milk Processor Board) \n 10. \"Get in the zone\" (AutoZone) \n Here are the most recalled slogans.

Photograph: Lindsey Parnaby/PA \n Maev Kennedy , arts and heritage correspondent \n Monday 8 December 2003 04.57 EST \n Share on Messenger \n Close \n Just as predicted, it was sex and death which won the Turner prize last night. What the bookmakers missed, however, was that the medium for the message was not the Chapman Brothers' rotting corpses and mutilated Goyas, but Grayson Perry's troublingly beautiful pots. \n The judges' verdict was anything but a foregone conclusion: it took hours longer than usual to reach a decision, and they went out of their way to praise \"the outstanding presentations produced by all four artists\". But, in the end, Perry's use of the traditions of ceramics and drawing, and his \"uncompromising engagement with personal and social concerns\" put him out front. \n His £20,000 prize, presented by Sir Peter Blake, will have to be shared with Claire, the burliest glamour girl in town, whose ruched satin \"coming out dress\", exquisitely embroidered with phallic symbols, hangs on one wall of his exhibition gallery. \n Claire is the alter ego of Basildon-born Perry - who is 43, six foot tall, and married with a daughter - and makes regular appearances at art scene parties. Her blue and white satin Bo-Peep outfit, complete with ribboned crook, is particularly unforgettable. \n Despite his maverick status, he has spoken of the contemporary art scene as a second family: \"There aren't many other worlds that would be so accepting of a transvestite potter from Essex.\" \n The Chapman Brothers were favourites from the start to take the £20,000 prize, but in recent weeks Tate staff noticed that while visitors were laughing or gasping at their plastic sex dolls cast in bronze and frozen in desolating oral sex, they were spending hours in the next gallery, poring in silence over Grayson Perry's seductively coloured pots. These are incised with a nightmare world of child abuse and violence, a landscape of tower blocks and burned out cars stalked by murderous moppets in Kate Greenaway frilly dresses. One is called We've Found The Body Of Your Child. Another pot, Boring Cool People, pokes fun at the very arty types now flocking to his shows and paying up to £25,000 for his vases - a price which can now safely be predicted to rise dramatically. \n One of his Turner prize pots is topped by a beautifully executed in-joke, a gilt teddy bear impaled on a tiny tree, echoing the corpses hanging from a life-size tree in the Chapmans' gallery next door. \n The comments wall for visitors confirmed the trend. By the end of last week far more were voting for Perry - \"great, great, great pots\" one wrote - than for the Chapmans. Between them the artists left the other contenders, Willie Doherty's angsty video piece of a man running desperately across an endless bridge, and Anya Gallaccio's decaying flowers and seeping apples, trailing far in their wake. \n Grayson Perry's unique style was created 25 years ago, when he was living in a squat in Camden, where it was not common practice among the anarchic denizens to attend pottery classes. His first plate was inscribed Kinky Sex, and he has said he partly enjoyed pottery \"because it was so easy\". \n From the age of 13 he knew he was a cross-dresser, he has said, adding that the secret was discovered when his stepsister spied in his diary, and asked their mother what \"transvestism\" meant. \n He has already said that he might spend some of the prize money on his wife and daughter, and some on new dresses for Claire. \"Believe me, Claire's a very expensive woman to keep in clothes.\" \n The Stuckists, apostles of painting over conceptual art, and self-appointed scourges of \"the Serota tendency\" (named after"}

{"question": "What is the main component of the aboral organ?", "answers": ["a statocyst", "statocyst", "statocyst"], "context": "The largest single sensory feature is the aboral organ (at the opposite end from the mouth). Its main component is a statocyst, a balance sensor consisting of a statolith, a solid particle supported on four bundles of cilia, called \"balancers\", that sense its orientation. The statocyst is protected by a transparent dome made of long, immobile cilia. A ctenophore does not automatically try to keep the statolith resting equally on all the balancers. Instead its response is determined by the animal's \"mood\", in other words the overall state of the nervous system. For example, if a ctenophore with trailing tentacles captures prey, it will often put some comb rows into reverse, spinning the mouth towards the prey."}
{"question": "Which castle near Deal in Kent has served, since 1708, as the official residence of the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports?", "answers": ["walmer castle"], "context": "WalmerWeb: Local History - Walmer CastleWalmerWeb: Local History - Walmer Castle \n Local history \n   \n The Queen Mother's                          Garden, Walmer Castle \n Walmer Castle was built during the reign                      of Henry VIII as part of a chain of coastal artillery defences                      to meet his fears of a Catholic attack from Europe. It                      was the southernmost of three forts on this section of the                      Kent coast guarding a sheltered anchorage in the English Channel                      known as The Downs. The other two forts were Deal Castle which,                      like Walmer Castle, continues as a popular visitor attraction                      and Sandown Castle which, sadly, fell into disrepair and today                      is little more than a few stones on the seafront at north                      Deal. \n The design of Walmer Castle comprises a circular central keep, encased by four outer bastions - one                      of which serves as a gatehouse. It is surrounded by a deep,                      wide moat. In the 18th- and 19th- centuries, the upper levels                      of the outer bastions were modified and apartments added,                      turning the Castle into an elegant home. In 1708 it became                      the official residence of the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports,                      a role undertaken by many notable people since then. \n Among these are William Pitt the Younger                      (Lord Warden from 1792 to 1806), The Duke of Wellington (1829                      until 1852), high street stationer William Henry (W.H.) Smith                      (1891), former Australian prime minister Sir Robert Menzies                      (1966-1978) and Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother (1978-2002).                      They and other Lord Wardens contributed to the development                      of the Castle in various ways. Today's visitors will find                      Pitt remembered in the Pitt Room where many items of his personal                      property are preserved. The fine gardens were designed by                      his niece Lady Hester Stanhope who, later, achieved fame through                      her visits to the Middle East. \n Wellington's strong links with the Castle                      remain and pieces of furniture he used, such as the armchair                      in which he died on 14 September 1852 and his campaign bed,                      are on display along with many personal effects such as items                      of uniform and clothing including a pair of original \"Wellington                      boots\". The Duke entertained many famous people at the                      Castle - including Queen Victoria and Prince Albert - and                      the rooms they occupied are maintained much as they were during                      their visit. \n Another royal visitor was Queen Elizabeth                      the Queen Mother who, as Lord Warden, regularly stayed at                      the Castle. Some of the rooms she used are open to visitors                      and the magnificent garden, created in celebration of her                      95th birthday, is one of the highlights of the Castle grounds.                      These also include a commemorative lawn, woodland walk, croquet                      lawn, a working kitchen garden and substantial areas attracting                      wildlife and birds. \n   \n Visiting Walmer Castle \n The entrance to Walmer Castle faces the seafront on Kingsdown                      Road, between Deal and Kingsdown village. It is well signposted                      from the A258 Dover Road in Walmer. \n Operated by English Heritage, the Castle and gardens have                      a tearoom and gift shop and plants are often on sale. An audio                      tour is available to help visitors appreciate the Castle's                      history and features. \n For more details of Walmer Castle, opening times, admission                      charges and events, see the English                      Heritage website . \n There are more photos of the Castle on WalmerWeb and also on the Castle                      Facts website . \n The Wikipedia on-line encyclopaedia has a History                      of the Cinque Ports and a detailed history of the Lord                      Warden of the Cinque Ports . \n   \n To return to the History menu CLICK                            HERE \n   \n <span class=\"bodytext\">This          page uses inline frames.<br>         If your browser does not support <br>         them, you will see this message.</span>  Deal Castle, Kent (Pepys' Diary)Deal Castle, Kent (Pepys' Diary) \n Deal Castle, Kent \n City of London wall and Great Fire damage – Hollar's 1666 map after the Fire \n Summary \n This text was"}

{"question": "What does a 2013 report on Nigeria suggest it's growth has done?", "answers": ["risen with increased income inequality", "risen", "risen"], "context": "Some theories developed in the 1970s established possible avenues through which inequality may have a positive effect on economic development. According to a 1955 review, savings by the wealthy, if these increase with inequality, were thought to offset reduced consumer demand. A 2013 report on Nigeria suggests that growth has risen with increased income inequality. Some theories popular from the 1950s to 2011 incorrectly stated that inequality had a positive effect on economic development. Analyses based on comparing yearly equality figures to yearly growth rates were misleading because it takes several years for effects to manifest as changes to economic growth. IMF economists found a strong association between lower levels of inequality in developing countries and sustained periods of economic growth. Developing countries with high inequality have \"succeeded in initiating growth at high rates for a few years\" but \"longer growth spells are robustly associated with more equality in the income distribution.\""}

In 1901, Sir George Donaldson donated several pieces of art Nouveau furniture to the museum, which he had acquired the previous year at the Paris Exposition Universelle.

The network's finances improved and allowed it to invest in other properties and programming. In May 1960, ABC purchased Chicago radio station WLS, which had shared airtime with WENR since the 1920s. This acquisition allowed ABC to consolidate its presence in the market. On May 9, 1960, WLS launched a new lineup consisting of ABC Radio programming.

The Treaties contain formal and substantive provisions, which frame policies of the European Union institutions and determine the division of competences between the European Union and its member states. The TEU establishes that European Union law applies to the metropolitan territories of the member states, as well as certain islands and overseas territories, including Madeira, the Canary Islands and the French overseas departments. European Union law also applies in territories where a member state is responsible for external relations, for example Gibraltar and the Åland islands. The TEU allows the European Council to make specific provisions for regions, as for example done for customs matters in Gibraltar and Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon. The TEU specifically excludes certain regions, for example the Faroe Islands, from the jurisdiction of European Union law. Treaties apply as soon as they enter into force, unless stated otherwise, and are generally concluded for an unlimited period. The TEU provides that commitments entered into by the member states between themselves before the treaty was signed no longer apply.[vague] All EU member states are regarded as subject to the general obligation of the principle of cooperation, as stated in the TEU, whereby member states are obliged not to take measure which could jeopardise the attainment of the TEU objectives. The Court of Justice of the European Union can interpret the Treaties, but it cannot rule on their validity, which is subject to international law. Individuals may rely on primary law in the Court of Justice of the European Union if the Treaty provisions have a direct effect and they are sufficiently clear, precise and unconditional."}

{"question": "How long after a banquet with Tugh Temur did Kusala die?", "answers": ["four days", "four days", "four days"], "context": "When Yesün Temür died in Shangdu in 1328, Tugh Temür was recalled to Khanbaliq by the Qipchaq commander El Temür. He was installed as the emperor (Emperor Wenzong) in Khanbaliq, while Yesün Temür's son Ragibagh succeeded to the throne in Shangdu with the support of Yesün Temür's favorite retainer Dawlat Shah. Gaining support from princes and officers in Northern China and some other parts of the dynasty, Khanbaliq-based Tugh Temür eventually won the civil war against Ragibagh known as the War of the Two Capitals. Afterwards, Tugh Temür abdicated in favour of his brother Kusala, who was backed by Chagatai Khan Eljigidey, and announced Khanbaliq's intent to welcome him. However, Kusala suddenly died only four days after a banquet with Tugh Temür. He was supposedly killed with poison by El Temür, and Tugh Temür then remounted the throne. Tugh Temür also managed to send delegates to the western Mongol khanates such as Golden Horde and Ilkhanate to be accepted as the suzerain of Mongol world. However, he was mainly a puppet of the powerful official El Temür during his latter three-year reign. El Temür purged pro-Kusala officials and brought power to warlords, whose despotic rule clearly marked the decline of the dynasty."}

{"question": "What kind of act does Whaling in Australia and Right whale have in common?", "answers": ["hunt"], "context": "Whaling in Australia  Whaling in Australia commenced in 1791 when two of the ships which had brought convicts and free settlers to the penal colony of New South Wales (Australia) as part of the Third Fleet engaged in whaling and seal hunting activities before returning to England.  The main varieties of whales hunted were humpback, blue, right and sperm whales. \n  Right whale  Right whales are three species of large baleen whales of the genus Eubalaena: the North Atlantic right whale (\"E. glacialis\"), the North Pacific right whale (\"E. japonica\") and the Southern right whale (\"E. australis\").  They are classified in the family Balaenidae with the bowhead whale.  Right whales have rotund bodies with arching rostrums, V-shaped blowholes and dark gray or black skin.  The most distinguishing feature of a right whale is the rough patches of skin on its head which appear white due to parasitism by whale lice.  Right whales can grow up to more than 18 m long with the maximum record of 19.8 m and weigh up to 100 ST or more; 20.7 m with 135000 kg or 21.3 m with uncertainty, being significantly larger than other coastal species such as humpbacks, grays, or eden's and omura's, but smaller than blues.  One (apocryphal) explanation for their name is that right whales were named by whalers who identified them as the \"right\" whale to kill on a hunt due to the plentiful oil and baleen they could provide."}

{"question": "What was the Best Picture winner?", "answers": ["\"Slumdog Millionaire\""], "context": "(Entertainment Weekly) -- After all the anticipation and hubbub, the weekend is coming to an end and the box office results are here: \"Watchmen\" (No. 1) grossed $55.7 million during its first frame, according to early estimates from Media by Numbers.\n\n\"Watchmen\" led the weekend box office, grossing $55.7 million during its first weekend.\n\nThat's a solid sum, to be sure, although it's certainly on the low end of most projections. \"Watchmen\" premiered in more theaters (3,611) than any other R-rated movie in history, and it averaged an impressive $15,413 per venue, despite a potentially problematic long running time.\n\nIt also scored the biggest debut of 2009 so far. Nonetheless, the movie's $55.7 million take (including $5.5 million from 124 IMAX screens) is substantially smaller than the $70.9 million that 300, the last R-rated graphic-novel movie from director Zack Snyder, earned on its opening weekend two years ago.\n\nAnd aside from that theater-count statistic (which almost any film could break at any time, really), there will be no major records to report on this weekend (for example, \"Watchmen's\" debut was just the fifth-best opening ever for an R-rated movie).\n\nI'd argue, in fact, that this opening is a bit soft, considering the great expectations that came with Snyder's adaptation of Alan Moore's landmark comic book -- not to mention \"Watchmen's\" hefty grosses from screenings at midnight on Friday and throughout its first day. After attracting some major initial interest, banking $25.1 million on Friday, the film's audience dropped off dramatically during the weekend: It grossed $19 million on Saturday and is expected to bring in just $11.5 million on Sunday.\n\nThese are all big numbers, don't get me wrong, but, when combined with the fact that the film got a lukewarm CinemaScore grade of B from an audience that was largely comprised of older men, it all points to a rapid downward trend that may be difficult to reverse in the weeks to come.\n\nElsewhere -- yes, there were other movies playing at the multiplex this weekend! -- a number of films continued to do what \"Watchmen\" must now aspire to, perhaps in vain: They stayed strong deep into their long runs.\n\nTyler Perry's \"Madea Goes to Jail\" (No. 2) grossed $8.8 million on its third weekend; the film, Perry's biggest yet at the box office, has banked $76.5 million to date.\n\n\"Taken\" (No. 3) also moved along like the unstoppable force it has been for more than a month now, earning $7.5 million and bringing its six-week sum to $118 million.\n\nBest Picture winner \"Slumdog Millionaire\" (No. 4) was next with $6.9 million, which boosted its domestic haul to $125.4 million. And \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop\" (No. 5) took its eight-week total to $133.6 million thanks to another $4.2 million gross. iReport.com: What did you think of 'Watchmen'?\n\nMeanwhile, \"Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience\" (No. 9) completely fell off the map, dropping a staggering 78 percent to gross just $2.8 million. According to Box Office Mojo, that's the 15th biggest second-weekend decline of all time.\n\nOverall, the cumulative box office was up nearly 8 percent over the same frame a year ago, when 10,000 B.C. opened big, making this the fifth consecutive \"up\" weekend at the multiplex. So, all in all, I'd say today's was a good report, indeed.\n\nCLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly"}

Such self-interest directly conflicts with the patient's interest in obtaining cost-effective medication and avoiding the unnecessary use of medication that may have side-effects.

{"question": "What did Hamas spokesman call sheikh's followers?", "answers": ["\"outlaws\""], "context": "GAZA CITY (CNN) -- A radical Muslim sheikh called Friday for the creation of an Islamic emirate in Gaza, sparking clashes with Hamas forces that left 13 people dead, Hamas sources tell CNN.\n\n\n\nArmed members of the radical Islamist group Jund Ansar Allah surround a group representative in Rafah on Friday.\n\n\n\nThe clashes ended after several hours, after Hamas forces blew up the home of Sheikh Abu al-Nour al-Maqdessi, leader of the Salafist jihadist group Jund Ansar Allah, or Soldiers of the Partisans of God, the sources said.\n\n\n\nAl-Maqdessi escaped, they said, and Hamas security forces were searching for him.\n\n\n\nThe clashes were the latest between Gaza's Hamas rulers, who have said they are moderate Muslims pledged to the Palestinian cause, and more radical Islamic groups.\n\n\n\nIn a televised statement, Hamas ministry spokesman Taher Nunu called al-Maqdessi's group \"outlaws\" and said they have been \"terrorizing the country and attacking civilians.\"\n\n\n\n\"We hold the group and its leader fully responsible for what is happening in Gaza, and we offer our condolences to everyone who was killed during the clashes,\" Nunu said. \"No one is above the law, and we urge everyone who is a member of this group to surrender himself to the authorities, or they will be accountable for all of their actions.\"\n\n\n\nThe gunfighting erupted near a mosque in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, where the cleric delivered his sermon, the sources said. Hamas militants raided the mosque and seized control of it.\n\n\n\nLater, the fighting spread to al-Maqdessi's home, the sources said.\n\n\n\nThe fighting has left at least 13 dead and more than 100 wounded, the sources said.\n\n\n\nAl-Maqdessi also called for a public meeting at the mosque, posting on Jund Ansar Allah's Web site an invitation dubbed \"the golden advice to the government of [Hamas leader] Ismail Haniya.\"\n\n\n\nThe group posted a statement on the site announcing the establishment of the Islamic emirate in Gaza and proclaiming al-Maqdessi \"the commander of the faithful.\" The statement declared that armed forces in Gaza should unite under him.\n\n\n\nThe statement urged Muslims everywhere to support the \"young emirate\" and provide the group with money, weapons and men because \"this is the hope of the Muslim nation in raising the banner of monotheism in Palestine and to liberate all the lands and purify Al-Aqsa mosque from the filth of the damned Jews.\"\n\n\n\nAl-Aqsa mosque is in Jerusalem.\n\n\n\nThe group accused Hamas of not being Islamic enough, saying Hamas cares more about pleasing \"tyrants\" than \"obeying God.\"\n\n\n\nBut Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zahri dismissed statements about the establishment of an Islamic emirate as \"theoretical.\"\n\n\n\n\"It is not permitted to any party or individual to enforce their own laws, because this is the responsibility of the security forces,\" he said.\n\n\n\nSalafi is the term used to describe the radical islamist movement that follows the doctrines of the \"Salaf,\" or the predecessors, referring to the early generations of Muslims. The movement rejects all modern influences such as politics and government.\n\n\n\nCNN's Talal Abu-Rahman in Gaza City contributed to this report."}

The militants retreated to a compound and attacked ISAF troops with small arms.\n\nTroops surrounded the compound and urged them to surrender peacefully after it was cordoned off. It also asked the people in the compound to release women and children but no civilians left.\n\nTroops assaulted the compound and 12 male insurgents were killed in gunfire. Troops found one woman who was killed in the crossfire by insurgent small arms fire, ISAF said.\n\nAn investigation is being conducted by Afghan National Security Forces at the site. Initial indications show that the woman was killed by insurgent small arms fire.\n\nEight AK47 rifles, two rocket propelled grenade launchers, several rocket canisters, 82mm mortars, and two heavy machine guns were found in the compound.\n\n\"ANSF and ISAF are making significant progress against insurgent groups in Logar province who are involved in murdering civilians with IEDs,\" said Brig. Gen. Richard Blanchette, ISAF spokesman.\n\n\"Today's firefight illustrates the difference between ISAF troops who risk their lives to protect civilians, and insurgents who deliberately and tragically place civilians at risk.\"\n\nAlso, ISAF reported the death of a soldier from the NATO-led force Friday in eastern Afghanistan.\n\nThe soldier died of wounds and another was injured after what was described as a \"hostile incident.\"\n\n\"On behalf of the men and women of the International Security Assistance Force, I offer our heartfelt condolences to the loved ones of the brave soldier killed, and our support to the soldier wounded in this incident,\" Blanchette said.\n\n\"As we recognize their sacrifice in our battle against a vicious insurgency, we will continue supporting the Afghan National Security Forces so that the Afghan people reap the tangible benefits of peace in their day-to-day lives.\"\n\nOvernight in the southern Afghan province of Helmand, troops killed four militants in an operation targeting a mid-level Taliban commander responsible for attacks against Afghan civilians and coalition forces.\n\nThe commander directed attacks in December in Musa Qala, including one that killed 12 Afghan civilians."}

{"question": "How much do ctenophore eat in a day?", "answers": ["ten times their own weight", "ten times their own weight", "ten times their own weight"], "context": "Almost all ctenophores are predators, taking prey ranging from microscopic larvae and rotifers to the adults of small crustaceans; the exceptions are juveniles of two species, which live as parasites on the salps on which adults of their species feed. In favorable circumstances, ctenophores can eat ten times their own weight in a day. Only 100–150 species have been validated, and possibly another 25 have not been fully described and named. The textbook examples are cydippids with egg-shaped bodies and a pair of retractable tentacles fringed with tentilla (\"little tentacles\") that are covered with colloblasts, sticky cells that capture prey. The phylum has a wide range of body forms, including the flattened, deep-sea platyctenids, in which the adults of most species lack combs, and the coastal beroids, which lack tentacles and prey on other ctenophores by using huge mouths armed with groups of large, stiffened cilia that act as teeth. These variations enable different species to build huge populations in the same area, because they specialize in different types of prey, which they capture by as wide a range of methods as spiders use."}
{"question": "What is the name of Kevin the teenager's friend played by Kathy Burke in a series of sketches with Harry Enfield?", "answers": ["perry"], "context": "Harry Enfield - Celebrity information - Mystic GamesHarry Enfield - Celebrity information \n Harry Enfield \n HARRY ENFIELD \n Biography: \n Harry Enfield (born May 30, 1961 in Sussex, England) is a comedian educated at Derwent College at the University of York who quickly came to prominence after appearing on Channel 4's Saturday Live in a number of different personae created with Paul Whitehouse. These quickly entered the national consciousness. \n Amongst these characters was the Greek kebab-seller with markedly fractured English, \"Stavros\", a profound supporter of the football club Arsenal F.C., which he demonstrated by frequently uttering the phrase \"Up the Arse\". \n His other popular character \"Loadsamoney\" (an obnoxious character who constantly boasted about how much money he earns) spawned a hit single in 1988 and sell out live tour. As a foil to \"Loadsamoney\" Enfield and Whitehouse created the Geordie \"Bugger-All-Money\" and in 1988 Enfield appeared as both characters during the 'Nelson Mandela Birthday Tribute Concert' at Wembley Stadium. In time Whitehouse and Enfield became disturbed that the \"Loadsamoney\" was being seen as a positive image and killed him off. In 1989 Enfield realised a personal project with the spoof of British Theatre Knights slumming in the film industry Sir Norbert Smith: A Life. \n Before that he provided voices for the British satirical puppet show Spitting Image. \n In 1990, Enfield moved to the BBC where he developed his sketch show, Harry Enfield's Television Programme, and later Harry Enfield and Chums with fellow comedians Paul Whitehouse (later of Fast Show fame) and Kathy Burke. This created more nationally recognised characters such as \"Mr. and Mrs. Loadsamoney\", \"Tim, nice but dim\" (a character frighteningly similar to the British Conservative politician Boris Johnson), \"Smashie and Nicey\", \"Wayne Slob\" and \"Annoying Kid Brother\" who grew into \"Kevin The Teenager\". Two characters played by Enfield and Jon Glover, Mr Cholmondley-Warner and Grayson appeared for several years both in the series' mock 1950s information film sketches, and in television commercials for the first of the privatised UK telephone companies, Mercury Communications. Enfield is a professed fan of classical opera and for Channel 4 fronted a documentary series on the subject. \n His first sitcom appearance came in 1992, when he played \"Dermot\" in Men Behaving Badly on ITV. He left after the first series, and was replaced by Neil Morrissey, who played 'Tony' in the subsequent five series, and various one-off specials. \n In 2000 Enfield appeared in a his first leading film role playing \"Kevin\" alongside Kathy Burke, who played the character's male friend \"Perry\" - roles originally created for the television series - in Kevin & Perry Go Large. The film charted the pair's attempt to become professional DJs by travelling to the nightclubs of Ibiza and molesting their idol DJ \"Eyeball Paul\", played by Rhys Ifans, whilst gaining love but losing virginity along the way. \n Enfield appearances in commercials have been prolific, including the 1996 run for Dime Bar. (One memorable commercial in this series had Enfield as a country yokel refusing a Dime bar with its crunchy centre because he preferred armadilloes - soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside.) In 2004, he starred in a series of commercials for Burger King in the US as Dr. Angus, a character designed to promote the company's newest hamburger. \n After a short break Enfield signed a new contract with BSkyB, but only produced one series which flopped badly. In 2002 Enfield returned to the BBC with Celeb, a new series based on the comic strip of the same name in Private Eye, as the ageing rockstar character, Gary Bloke. \n As of 2004, Enfield provided the voice of \"The Roaming Gnome\" character used in Travelocity's US advertising campaign. \n He has a son and two daughters with his second wife, Lucy. \n Harry's father, Edward Enfield, has also made a few appearances as a television presenter on British television. \n Chinese Horoscope for Harry Enfield \n Includes characteristics and Vices  Harry Enfield Presents Kevin's Video"}

As well during awake active times, anti-inflammatory molecules, such as cortisol and catecholamines, peak. There are two theories as to why the pro-inflammatory state is reserved for sleep time. First, inflammation would cause serious cognitive and physical impairments if it were to occur during wake times. Second, inflammation may occur during sleep times due to the presence of melatonin. Inflammation causes a great deal of oxidative stress and the presence of melatonin during sleep times could actively counteract free radical production during this time."}

The house derives its name from a weaving school which was moved there in the last years of the 19th century, reviving an earlier use.) Others refugees practised the variety of occupations necessary to sustain the community as distinct from the indigenous population.

What more do they want other than for me to pack my bags and leave and if that's the case, then admit that that is the policy. Pass a law: no whites are allowed to farm. Then it makes it clear,\" Lock said.\n\n\n\nSince 2000, Mugabe's controversial land reform program has driven more than 4,000 commercial farmers off their land, destroying Zimbabwe's once prosperous agricultural sector.\n\n\n\n\"When the land reform program began, we decided we were not going to have a confrontational attitude; that we would actually go along with this program because it was the only way that this whole thing would be sorted out. So I voluntarily gave away my own farm and moved onto my father-in-law's farm,\" Lock said.\n\n\n\nThat was in 2002. A year later the government came knocking on his door again, he said, demanding more land.\n\n\n\nLock told CNN he eventually gave up 70 percent of his father-in-law's farm, which he then owned. Now an army general is demanding Lock's remaining 30 percent.\n\n\n\nWhen Zimbabwe's new unity government was formed -- with Mugabe's ZANU-PF and Morgan Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change -- in February this year, the general allegedly posted soldiers on Lock's farm. The farmer said he stopped farming and trade at gun point.\n\n\n\nWhen CNN visited Lock's farm this month, workers were standing idle. Maize and tobacco, which Lock said is worth more than U.S. $1 million, lay in storage.\n\n\n\n\"They've switched off our irrigation system, taken out keys and stop our trucks if we want to deliver maize,\" he told CNN.\n\n\n\nSo Lock had to sneak into his own property like a thief by cutting open the gate leading to his store room. He took a few valuables from his workshop suspecting that his whole place will soon be looted.\n\n\n\nWith the formation of a unity government farmers were hoping for some protection but Lock said: \"Nothing is happening here. There is no land audit happening, no one comes out here to check, to see. We are just left vulnerable.\"\n\n\n\nOn another farm, Ben Freeth's fight for his land has just escalated to another level.\n\n\n\nFreeth has been repeatedly beaten, arrested and harassed. Now his farmhouse and that of his father-in-law have been gutted by a mysterious fire. See the destruction the fire caused\n\n\n\nFreeth could not say for sure that this is arson but told CNN that the group of ZANU-PF youths who have occupied his farm have repeatedly threatened to burn his house.\n\n\n\n\"One time they came round with burning sacks at night and they started making a huge noise and ringing a great big bell and shouting and screaming. They were going underneath the thatch saying we are going to burn your house down if you don't get out,\" he said.\n\n\n\nFreeth and his father-in-law Mike Campbell are among a group of Zimbabwean farmers who won the right to remain on their land at a southern African tribunal.\n\n\n\nBut Mugabe has declared the ruling null and void and pulled out of the tribunal. Farmers cannot contest land issues in Zimbabwe and approaching international courts has thus far not worked either.\n\n\n\nWhen CNN interviewed Mugabe's minister of state, Didymas Mutasa, about the disregard for human and property rights on the farms, he blamed"}
{"question": "How and when did the first variant of y. pestis enter Europe?", "answers": ["through the port of Marseille around November 1347", "the port of Marseille around November 1347", "1347"], "context": "The study also found that there were two previously unknown but related clades (genetic branches) of the Y. pestis genome associated with medieval mass graves. These clades (which are thought to be extinct) were found to be ancestral to modern isolates of the modern Y. pestis strains Y. p. orientalis and Y. p. medievalis, suggesting the plague may have entered Europe in two waves. Surveys of plague pit remains in France and England indicate the first variant entered Europe through the port of Marseille around November 1347 and spread through France over the next two years, eventually reaching England in the spring of 1349, where it spread through the country in three epidemics. Surveys of plague pit remains from the Dutch town of Bergen op Zoom showed the Y. pestis genotype responsible for the pandemic that spread through the Low Countries from 1350 differed from that found in Britain and France, implying Bergen op Zoom (and possibly other parts of the southern Netherlands) was not directly infected from England or France in 1349 and suggesting a second wave of plague, different from those in Britain and France, may have been carried to the Low Countries from Norway, the Hanseatic cities or another site."}
{"question": "In what process are electrons recycled?", "answers": ["cyclic photophosphorylation", "cyclic photophosphorylation", "cyclic photophosphorylation"], "context": "While photosystem II photolyzes water to obtain and energize new electrons, photosystem I simply reenergizes depleted electrons at the end of an electron transport chain. Normally, the reenergized electrons are taken by NADP+, though sometimes they can flow back down more H+-pumping electron transport chains to transport more hydrogen ions into the thylakoid space to generate more ATP. This is termed cyclic photophosphorylation because the electrons are recycled. Cyclic photophosphorylation is common in C4 plants, which need more ATP than NADPH."}

{"question": "Who suggests Sanford may have to step down?", "answers": ["Karen Floyd"], "context": "COLUMBIA, South Carolina (CNN)  -- South Carolina Republican Party Chairwoman Karen Floyd seemed to suggest Wednesday that the time had come for GOP Gov. Mark Sanford to consider resigning from office.\n\n\n\nGov. Mark Sanford has said it's better for him to keep his governorship to \"learn lessons.\"\n\n\n\n\"For the past two days, I have been speaking with Republican leaders across South Carolina,\" she said in a statement. \"There is clearly a growing view that the time may have come for Governor Sanford to remove himself and his family from the limelight, so that he can devote his efforts full-time to repairing the damage in his personal life.\"\n\n\n\nThe statement comes on the same day as a growing number of GOP state senators called for Sanford to step down.\n\n\n\nCNN has learned that GOP Sens. Daniel Verdin, Shane Martin, Ronnie Cromer and Wes Hayes joined the anti-Sanford chorus Wednesday morning, bringing the total number of Republican senators calling for the governor's resignation to 13. There are 27 Republicans in the state Senate.\n\n\n\nAnother state senator stopped just short of calling for Sanford to step down Wednesday. Glenn McConnell, Senate president pro tempore, didn't explicitly ask Sanford to resign, but he did ask him \"to do the right thing for himself, his family and our state.\"\n\n\n\nSanford and his staff have said repeatedly this week that he will not resign. He wrote in a message to his political action committee e-mail list Monday that while he considered resigning, \"I would ultimately be a better person and of more service in whatever doors God opened next in life if I stuck around to learn lessons rather than running and hiding down at the farm.\"\n\n\n\nAfter returning last week from a secret trip to Argentina that his staff and wife didn't know about, Sanford admitted to an extramarital affair with a woman identified as Maria Belen Chapur. Sanford also told The Associated Press on Tuesday that he's \"crossed lines\" with other women, although Chapur was the only one he had sex with.  Watch a report on Sanford's situation »\n\n\n\nSanford's support among legislators and grassroots leaders in the state eroded considerably Tuesday after Sanford told The Associated Press he had met with his mistress more times than he had previously disclosed. He also admitted to dalliances with other women.\n\n\n\nAt least four county GOP chairmen have also called for Sanford to go.\n\n\n\nGlenn McCall, the York County Republican Party chairman who has been leading a grassroots effort against the governor, said Wednesday that he and other conservative activists are postponing a rally at the State House next week because legislators are starting to come out strongly against Sanford.\n\n\n\nThe rally had been scheduled to pressure Senate and House leaders to call for Sanford's resignation and start an investigation into his activities. But now that officials are publicly coming out against the governor and Attorney General Henry McMaster has begun investigating Sanford's travel records, McCall said the rally may not be necessary.\n\n\n\n\"We are hoping that legislators can quietly, in private talks with the governor, ask him if he would please step down,\" McCall said.\n\n\n\nA top South Carolina Democrat also called for Sanford's resignation Wednesday. \"While I believe an investigation should still be done to determine the full extent of Mark Sanford's abuse of power, [through] his long stream of confessions he has already revealed enough immoral and reprehensible behavior to justify asking him to step [down],\" state Democratic Party Chairwoman Carol Fowler said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\"State officials seem unable to do anything except worry and talk about Governor Sanford's extramarital affair, which we learn more about every few hours.\n\n\n\n\"... South Carolina can't afford to be at a standstill for the next 18 months with a governor who ignores his job responsibilities while pursuing personal interests,\" the statement said. \"Any other worker in South Carolina would be fired for not showing up at work with no notice.\"\n\n\n\nLate Tuesday, seven GOP senators, including Majority Leader Harvey Peeler, jointly issued a letter demanding that the governor step down because he has lost the trust of South"}

{"question": "Rolls-Royce Welland's name is taken from this river that is low long", "answers": ["65 mi"], "context": "Rolls-Royce Welland  The Rolls-Royce RB.23 Welland was Britain's first production jet engine.  It entered production in 1943 for the Gloster Meteor.  The name Welland is taken from the River Welland, in keeping with the Rolls-Royce policy of naming early jet engines after rivers based on the idea of continuous flow, air through the engine and water in a river. \n  River Welland  The River Welland is a lowland river in the east of England, some 65 mi long.  It drains part of the Midlands eastwards to The Wash.  The river rises in the Hothorpe Hills, at Sibbertoft in Northamptonshire, then flows generally northeast to Market Harborough, Stamford and Spalding, to reach The Wash near Fosdyke.  It is a major waterway across the part of the Fens called South Holland, and is one of the Fenland rivers which were laid out with washlands.  There are two channels between widely spaced embankments with the intention that flood waters would have space in which to spread while the tide in the estuary prevented free egress.  However, after the floods of 1947, new works such as the Coronation Channel were constructed to control flooding in Spalding and the washes are no longer used solely as pasture, but may be used for arable farming."}

{"question": "By 1897, how much had Tesla, Brown, and Peck received in royalties and licenses over the patents?", "answers": ["$200,000", "estimated $200,000", "an estimated $200,000"], "context": "The mid 1890s saw the conglomerate General Electric, backed by financier J. P. Morgan, involved in takeover attempts and patent battles with Westinghouse Electric. Although a patent-sharing agreement was signed between the two companies in 1896 Westinghouse was still cash-strapped from the financial warfare. To secure further loans, Westinghouse was forced to revisit Tesla's AC patent, which bankers considered a financial strain on the company (at that point Westinghouse had paid out an estimated $200,000 in licenses and royalties to Tesla, Brown, and Peck). In 1897, Westinghouse explained his financial difficulties to Tesla in stark terms, saying that if things continue the way they were he would no longer be in control of Westinghouse Electric and Tesla would have to \"deal with the bankers\" to try to collect future royalties. Westinghouse convinced Tesla to release his company from the licensing agreement over Tesla's AC patents in exchange for Westinghouse Electric purchasing the patents for a lump sum payment of $216,000; this provided Westinghouse a break from what, due to alternating current's rapid gain in popularity, had turned out to be an overly generous $2.50 per AC horsepower royalty."}

At Deshun, the Tangut general Ma Jianlong put up a fierce resistance for several days and personally led charges against the invaders outside the city gate. Ma Jianlong later died from wounds received from arrows in battle. Genghis Khan, after conquering Deshun, went to Liupanshan (Qingshui County, Gansu Province) to escape the severe summer. The new Tangut emperor quickly surrendered to the Mongols, and the rest of the Tanguts officially surrendered soon after. Not happy with their betrayal and resistance, Genghis Khan ordered the entire imperial family to be executed, effectively ending the Tangut lineage."}

{"question": "If you do not know both magnitude and direction of two forces on an object, what would you call that situation?", "answers": ["ambiguous", "ambiguous", "ambiguous", "ambiguous", "ambiguous"], "context": "Forces act in a particular direction and have sizes dependent upon how strong the push or pull is. Because of these characteristics, forces are classified as \"vector quantities\". This means that forces follow a different set of mathematical rules than physical quantities that do not have direction (denoted scalar quantities). For example, when determining what happens when two forces act on the same object, it is necessary to know both the magnitude and the direction of both forces to calculate the result. If both of these pieces of information are not known for each force, the situation is ambiguous. For example, if you know that two people are pulling on the same rope with known magnitudes of force but you do not know which direction either person is pulling, it is impossible to determine what the acceleration of the rope will be. The two people could be pulling against each other as in tug of war or the two people could be pulling in the same direction. In this simple one-dimensional example, without knowing the direction of the forces it is impossible to decide whether the net force is the result of adding the two force magnitudes or subtracting one from the other. Associating forces with vectors avoids such problems."}

{"question": "What are colloblasts?", "answers": ["specialized mushroom-shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis", "specialized mushroom-shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis", "specialized mushroom-shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis"], "context": "The tentacles of cydippid ctenophores are typically fringed with tentilla (\"little tentacles\"), although a few genera have simple tentacles without these sidebranches. The tentacles and tentilla are densely covered with microscopic colloblasts that capture prey by sticking to it. Colloblasts are specialized mushroom-shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis, and have three main components: a domed head with vesicles (chambers) that contain adhesive; a stalk that anchors the cell in the lower layer of the epidermis or in the mesoglea; and a spiral thread that coils round the stalk and is attached to the head and to the root of the stalk. The function of the spiral thread is uncertain, but it may absorb stress when prey tries to escape, and thus prevent the collobast from being torn apart. In addition to colloblasts, members of the genus Haeckelia, which feed mainly on jellyfish, incorporate their victims' stinging nematocytes into their own tentacles – some cnidaria-eating nudibranchs similarly incorporate nematocytes into their bodies for defense. The tentilla of Euplokamis differ significantly from those of other cydippids: they contain striated muscle, a cell type otherwise unknown in the phylum Ctenophora; and they are coiled when relaxed, while the tentilla of all other known ctenophores elongate when relaxed. Euplokamis' tentilla have three types of movement that are used in capturing prey: they may flick out very quickly (in 40 to 60 milliseconds); they can wriggle, which may lure prey by behaving like small planktonic worms; and they coil round prey. The unique flicking is an uncoiling movement powered by contraction of the striated muscle. The wriggling motion is produced by smooth muscles, but of a highly specialized type. Coiling around prey is accomplished largely by the return of the tentilla to their inactive state, but the coils may be tightened by smooth muscle."}

James Mason | Biography, Movie Highlights and Photos ...James Mason | Biography, Movie Highlights and Photos | AllMovie \n twitter \n Biography                             by Lucia Bozzola \n Lending his mellifluous voice and regal mien to more than 100 films, British actor James Mason built a long career playing assorted villains, military men, and rather dubious romantic leads. \n Born the son of a wool merchant in the British mill town of Huddersfield, Mason excelled in school and earned a degree in architecture from Cambridge in 1931. Having acted in several school plays, however, he thought he had a better shot at earning a living as an actor rather than an architect during the Great Depression. Mason won his first professional role in The Rascal and made his debut in London's West End theater world in 1933 with Gallows Glorious. A year after he joined London's Old Vic theater, he made his screen debut in Late Extra in 1935. Mason became a regular British screen presence in late '30s \"quota quickies,\" including The High Command (1937). The actor made a career and personal breakthrough, however, with I Met a Murderer (1939). Along with co-writing, co-producing, and starring in the film, he also wound up marrying his leading lady, Pamela Kellino, in 1940. Mason became Britain's biggest screen star a few years later with his performance as the sadistic title character in the Gainsborough Studios melodrama The Man in Grey (1943). He cemented his fame as the cruel romantic leads women loved in the critically weak, but highly popular, Gainsborough costume dramas Fanny by Gaslight (1944) and The Wicked Lady (1945), finally achieving international stardom for his charismatic performance as Ann Todd's cane-wielding mentor in the well-received The Seventh Veil (1946). Rather than immediately going to Hollywood, however, Mason remained in England. Revealing that he could be more than just brutal leading men in weepy potboilers, he added an artistic as well as popular triumph to his credits with Carol Reed's Odd Man Out (1947). Starring Mason as a doomed IRA leader hunted by the police, Odd Man Out garnered international raves, and he often cited it as his favorite among his many films. \n After co-starring in the British drama The Upturned Glass (1947), the Masons headed to Hollywood in 1947. Spurning a long-term studio contract, Mason became one of Hollywood's busiest free agents. Anxious not to be typecast, he bucked his image as the irresistible sadist by playing trapped wife Barbara Bel Geddes' kind boss in Max Ophüls' Caught and appearing as Gustave Flaubert in Vincente Minnelli's version of Madame Bovary (both 1949). Mason returned to roguish form (albeit tempered by sympathy) with his second Ophüls film, The Reckless Moment. Along with two superb turns as wily, disillusioned German Field Marshal Rommel in The Desert Fox (1951) and The Desert Rats (1953), Mason also engaged in a glorious Technicolor romance with Ava Gardner in Pandora and the Flying Dutchman (1951) and played the villain in the swashbuckler The Prisoner of Zenda (1952). Calling on his suave intelligence, Mason starred as cool butler-turned-spy Cicero in what he considered his best Hollywood film, the espionage thriller 5 Fingers (1952). The actor played the treasonous Brutus in the director's excellent Shakespeare-adaptation Julius Caesar in 1953. \n Mason stepped behind the camera as director for the first and only time with the subsequent short film"}

One of the best examples of this architecture are Krasiński Palace (1677–1683), Wilanów Palace (1677–1696) and St. Kazimierz Church (1688–1692). The most impressive examples of rococo architecture are Czapski Palace (1712–1721), Palace of the Four Winds (1730s) and Visitationist Church (façade 1728–1761). The neoclassical architecture in Warsaw can be described by the simplicity of the geometrical forms teamed with a great inspiration from the Roman period. Some of the best examples of the neoclassical style are the Palace on the Water (rebuilt 1775–1795), Królikarnia (1782–1786), Carmelite Church (façade 1761–1783) and Evangelical Holy Trinity Church (1777–1782).

Missouri police did not have Mohler in custody earlier.\n\n\n\nOn the request of Missouri officials, Marion County authorities went to Mohler's home in Silver Springs, Florida, and caught him just before he pulled into the driveway, according to a news release from the Marion County Sheriff's Office. He was subsequently arrested.\n\n\n\nMohler told police he \"was aware of what was going on in Missouri,\" and that he had not been there since the 1980s, according to the sheriff's office.\n\n\n\nFive members of the Mohler family of Lafayette County, Missouri, were arrested earlier this week after six alleged victims, who are relatives of the five suspects, made accusations of sexual abuse. A sixth person, described as an \"associate\" of the family, was arrested Thursday but released Friday, police said.\n\n\n\nThe six alleged victims -- all now adults -- came to law enforcement authorities with stories of sexual performances, mock weddings, rape with various objects and a forced abortion during their childhoods, according to court documents obtained by CNN affiliate KSHB in Kansas City. CNN does not identify alleged sexual assault victims.\n\n\n\nPolice did not have enough to charge Darrel Mohler earlier, but after examining the victims' statements, obtained enough information to charge him, Alumbaugh said. He added that he does not think Darrel is on the run.\n\n\n\nDarrel Mohler, 72, is the younger brother of Burrell Edward Mohler Sr., 77, according to KSHB. On Tuesday, authorities arrested Mohler Sr. and his sons Burrell Edward Mohler Jr., 53; David A. Mohler, 52; Jared Leroy Mohler, 48; and Roland Neil Mohler, 47.\n\n\n\nMore charges against the family members are expected next week, the sheriff said. Current charges for some of the arrested include rape, deviate sexual assault and use [of] child in sexual performance, according to Missouri State Courts online case management system.\n\n\n\nAlumbaugh said that Larry Kidd, 55, of Kansas City, Missouri -- an \"associate\" of the Mohler family -- was picked up by police following a tip, cooperated with police and has been released.\n\n\n\nThe alleged abuse took place from the mid-1980s until 1995 and possibly beyond, the sheriff said earlier. The documents provide graphic details of the alleged abuse provided by one of the alleged victims. All of the charges stem from those documents, Alumbaugh said.\n\n\n\nMohler Sr., David Mohler and Jared Mohler are all lay ministers in the Community of Christ, the Independence, Missouri-based organization said in a statement.\n\n\n\nLay ministers are volunteers who do not receive compensation, said the organization, and none of the three served in leadership roles or worked with children.\n\n\n\nMohler Sr. went through the group's registered youth worker program, but \"his youth worker registration has been terminated and we understand he had no contact with children or youth in church programs,\" the statement said.\n\n\n\nSome lay ministers might help take care of the church, while others might speak at services, said the organization's spokeswoman, Linda Booth.\n\n\n\nThe Community of Christ is an offshoot of the modern-day Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It split off from the Mormon church in the 1800s, and in 2000 changed its name to Community of Christ from the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\n\n\nInvestigators earlier this week searched several properties for evidence, but there were no plans to continue the searches, Alumbaugh said Friday. He declined to comment on any evidence found.\n\n\n\nCNN's Sara Weisfeldt contributed to this report."}

Genghis Khan recalled Subutai back to Mongolia soon afterwards, and Jebe died on the road back to Samarkand. The famous cavalry expedition led by Subutai and Jebe, in which they encircled the entire Caspian Sea defeating all armies in their path, remains unparalleled to this day, and word of the Mongol triumphs began to trickle to other nations, particularly Europe. These two campaigns are generally regarded as reconnaissance campaigns that tried to get the feel of the political and cultural elements of the regions. In 1225 both divisions returned to Mongolia. These invasions added Transoxiana and Persia to an already formidable empire while destroying any resistance along the way. Later under Genghis Khan's grandson Batu and the Golden Horde, the Mongols returned to conquer Volga Bulgaria and Kievan Rus' in 1237, concluding the campaign in 1240."}

The stepwise mitigation of the ozone layer challenge was based as well on successfully reducing regional burden sharing conflicts. In case of the IPCC conclusions and the failure of the Kyoto Protocol, varying regional cost-benefit analysis and burden-sharing conflicts with regard to the distribution of emission reductions remain an unsolved problem. In the UK, a report for a House of Lords committee asked to urge the IPCC to involve better assessments of costs and benefits of climate change but the Stern Review ordered by the UK government made a stronger argument in favor to combat human-made climate change."}

After all, in 2007, only 9 percent of Turks polled by the Pew Research Center held favorable views of America, the lowest level among 47 countries surveyed.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf 24-year old Ece Basaran is any indicator, Obama succeeded beyond expectations.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter attending a town hall-style meeting with the American president during his visit to Istanbul last April, Basaran and a group of her friends started up a Turkish-American friendship club at her university.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I get positive feedback because everybody around me likes Obama,\" Basaran said, while taking a break from preparing for final exams at Istanbul's Bahcesehir University this week. Basaran said that as recently as last year, the United States was unpopular among fellow students and friends, but added that \"after Obama, it seems popular. At least the negative image began to fade away.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficials and commentators in both Turkey and the United States are also calling Obama's first presidential visit to a Muslim country a positive step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"At the moment, he's doing the right thing,\" said Suat Kiniklioglu, a member of the Turkish parliament. \"His first task was to remedy the situation of America wielding a big stick for the last eight years.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"President Obama's visit and recent policy initiatives have managed to dispel some of the pervasive suspicion in U.S.-Turkish relations -- no small achievement,\" said Ian Lesser of the German Marshall Fund, testifying before the House Foreign Affairs Committee last month. But, he added, \"much remains to be done.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are strong indications that words alone will not be enough to transform years of deep suspicion many Turks feel towards the United States, particularly after the long, widely unpopular war in neighboring Iraq.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to a recent poll published by academics at Bahcesehir University, 43 percent of Turks said they would not like to live next door to American neighbors.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a phone interview this week, Osman Solmaz, another of the Turkish students chosen to attend the town hall meeting with Obama, said that in his hometown, the southeastern Turkish city of Diyarbakir, \"the majority of the people have prejudice against the United States.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Nobody agrees with America's foreign policy,\" said Sertac Yakin, a university student from Ankara who also attended the Istanbul meeting in April.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"To change public opinion in Turkey is a long-term affair,\" argued Kemal Koprulu, the founder of Ari Movement, an Istanbul-based nongovernmental organization that focuses on promoting youth participation in civil society. \"There is no way that the election of a president and several nice statements from a State Department spokesman will change dramatically the public opinion in Turkey.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nKoprulu argued that his organization has documented alarmingly high levels of anti-Americanism and anti-Westernism among young Turks. He pointed out that at a recent academic conference at one of Turkey's most progressive universities in Istanbul, he witnessed audience members give a five-minute standing ovation to a Turkish speaker who \"slammed America\" in front of a panel of visiting U.S. officials.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe White House does appear to have made some progress in patching up damaged relations with the powerful Turkish military.\n\n\n\n\n\nTop Turkish army generals did not attend an important bilateral conference in the United States last year, following American criticism of Turkey's cross-border military offensive against Kurdish PKK rebels in Northern Iraq.

{"question": "How many top contenders are there for the Nobel Peace Prize?", "answers": ["three"], "context": "(CNN)  -- A controversial Colombian senator who has obtained the release of 16 hostages held by Marxist guerrillas is the leading candidate to receive this year's Nobel Peace Prize, which will be announced Friday, said an independent research institute in Norway.\n\n\n\nSen. Piedad Cordoba, right, of Colombia reportedly is one of three top contenders for the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n\n\nSen. Piedad Cordoba is the most likely recipient among three leading contenders, said the Oslo-based International Peace Research Institute. The others the institute named are Jordanian Prince Ghazi bin Muhammad, a philosophy professor in Islamic faith at Jordan University, and Afghan physician and human rights activist Sima Samar.\n\n\n\nThough the institute considers Cordoba the front-runner, no single candidate has emerged as the clear-cut favorite, as sometimes happens, said Kristian Berg Harpviken, director of the peace institute.\n\n\n\n\"It really is quite open this year,\" Harpviken said.\n\n\n\nThis year's peace prize nominees include 172 people and 33 organizations. The committee does not release the names of the nominees.\n\n\n\nThe 50-year-old peace institute, which is often called PRIO, has no connection with the Nobel committee that awards the peace prize.\n\n\n\nHarpviken said he believes the prize will go to an individual or organization engaged in the resolution of a protracted armed conflict.\n\n\n\n\"This is a [Nobel] committee that will perhaps be more proactive and will award somebody involved in a standing process rather than rewarding someone for past accomplishments,\" he said.\n\n\n\nCordoba, 54, heads Colombians for Peace, a group trying to end to the 45-year-old war between the government and the guerrilla Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as the FARC.\n\n\n\nSince 2007, she has obtained the release of 16 hostages held by the FARC and has gotten commitments from the rebels for the release of several more. Colombian officials have said the guerrillas are holding about 700 captives.\n\n\n\nA government critic and longtime peace activist, Cordoba was kidnapped by a right-wing paramilitary group in 1999. She was released after several weeks and then fled to Canada with her family, where she stayed for 14 months before returning home. There have been at least two assassinations attempts against her.\n\n\n\n\"While it is the hostage releases that have brought Cordoba and her organization the most attention, her role as a principal proponent of peace negotiations and of long-term reconciliation is probably more important to her candidacy for the Nobel Peace Prize,\" PRIO said in a release.\n\n\n\nHarpviken said he had received many complaints because of his prediction about Cordoba, whom critics accuse of being too close to the rebels. \"I do realize that this created some debate in Colombia,\" he said. \"That's not terribly surprising.\"\n\n\n\nCordoba was nominated by Argentinean human rights activist Adolfo Perez Esquivel, winner of the 1980 Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n\n\nHarpviken said Muhammad, an Islamic scholar known for trying to bridge gaps with other faiths, also is a leading candidate. \"Certainly, the purpose ... he stands for makes him very strong,\" Harpviken said.\n\n\n\nA member of the Jordanian royal family and educated at Princeton and Cambridge universities, where he received a doctorate, Muhammad, 42, \"is playing an increasingly central role as an advocate of interfaith dialogue,\" PRIO said.\n\n\n\nIn 2005, the prince brought together 170 Islamic scholars from 40 countries for the Amman Initiative to work out what they called a \"theological counter-attack against terrorism.\"\n\n\n\nTwo years later, Muhammad and other prominent Islamic scholars wrote a letter called \"A Common Word Between Us and You\" that urged mutual understanding and peace with Christians.\n\n\n\nThe letter, PRIO said, was partly a response to Pope Benedict XVI's 2006 lecture that many saw as an attack on Islam. Backing his words with his deeds, Muhammad gave what was considered a broadly accommodating welcoming speech when the pope visited Jordan this year.\n\n\n\n\"The importance of Prince Ghazi's initiatives to date lies first and foremost in the way he engages Islamic theology, institutions and leaders in a debate on the relationship between Islam and other faiths, thereby contributing a wider"}

It's narrated by Regine Candler \n  Stop motion  Stop motion (hyphenated stop-motion when used as an adjective) is an animation technique that physically manipulates an object so that it appears to move on its own.  The object is moved in small increments between individually photographed frames, creating the illusion of movement when the series of frames is played as a fast sequence.  Dolls with movable joints or clay figures are often used in stop motion for their ease of repositioning.  Stop motion animation using plasticine is called clay animation or \"clay-mation\".  Not all stop motion requires figures or models; many stop motion films can involve using humans, household appliances and other things for comedic effect.  Stop motion can also use sequential drawing in a similar manner to traditional animation, such as a flip book.

Producer Peter Rogers and director Gerald Thomas drew on a regular group of actors, the Carry On team, that included Sidney James, Kenneth Williams, Charles Hawtrey, Joan Sims, Kenneth Connor, Peter Butterworth, Hattie Jacques, Terry Scott, Bernard Bresslaw, Barbara Windsor, Jack Douglas and Jim Dale. \n The Carry On series contains the largest number of films of any British series; and, next to the James Bond films, it is the second-longest continually running UK film series although with a fourteen-year break (1978–92). Anglo Amalgamated Film Distributors Ltd produced twelve films (1958–66), and the Rank Organisation made the remaining nineteen (1967–92). \n Producer Peter Rogers and director Gerald Thomas made all 31 films, usually on time and to a strict budget, and often employed the same crew. Between 1958 and 1992, the series employed seven writers, most often Norman Hudis (1958–62) and Talbot Rothwell (1963–74). In between the films, Rogers and Thomas produced four Christmas specials in 1969, 1970, 1972 and 1973, a thirteen episode television series in 1975 and various West End stage shows which later toured the regions. \n All the films were made at Pinewood Studios near Iver Heath, Buckinghamshire. Budgetary constraints meant that a large proportion of the location filming was undertaken close to the studios in and around south Buckinghamshire, including areas of Berkshire and Middlesex. However, by the late-1960s (at the height of the franchise's success) more ambitious plots occasionally necessitated locations further afield, which included Snowdonia National Park, Wales (with the foot of Mount Snowdon acting as the Khyber Pass in Carry On Up the Khyber), and the beaches of the Sussex coast doubling as Saharan sand dunes in Follow That Camel. \n Background \n \"Carry On Sergeant\" (1958) was about a group of recruits on National Service and was in keeping with its setting, the titular order commonly issued by army officers to their sergeants in the course of their routine duties. The film was sufficiently successful to inspire a similar venture, again focusing on an established and respected profession in \"Carry On Nurse\". When that too was successful further forays with \"Carry On Teacher\" and \"Carry On Constable\" established the series. This initial 'pattern' was broken with the fifth film in 1961,\"Carry On Regardless\". \n The remainder of the series developed with increased use of the British comic traditions of Music Hall and bawdy seaside postcards. Many titles parodied more serious films, such as their tongue-in-cheek homages to James Bond (\"Carry On Spying\") and Hammer Horror (\"Carry On Screaming\"). The most impressive of these was Carry On Cleo (1964), after the  Burton and Taylor epic Cleopatra (1963), where the budget-conscious Carry On team made full use of some impressive sets which had been intended for that film. (\"Carry On Emmanuelle\", inspired by the soft-porn \"Emmanuelle\", brought to an end the original straight 'run'.) \n The stock-in-trade of Carry On humour was innuendo and the sending-up of British institutions and customs, such as the National Health Service (Nurse, Doctor, Again Doctor, Matron), the monarchy (Henry), the Empire (Up the Khyber), the armed forces (Sergeant) and the trade unions (At Your Convenience) as well as the Hammer horror film (Screaming), camping (Camping), foreigners (Abroad), beauty contests (Girls), and caravan holidays (Behind) among others. Although the films were very often panned by critics, they proved very popular with audiences.        \n A film had appeared in 1957 under the title Carry on Admiral; although this was a comedy in similar vein (and"}

{"question": "What are farmers fighting over?", "answers": ["to hold onto his land"], "context": "HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- A desperate Zimbabwean farmer fighting to hold onto his land -- a year after the country's political rivals pledged to govern jointly -- fears he will eventually lose to politics and violence.\n\n\n\nBen Freeth's farm was gutted by fire, as was his father-in-law's.\n\n\n\nThe power-sharing agreement included an undertaking by both parties to ensure property rights are upheld but farm attacks and invasions continue unabated in Zimbabwe.\n\n\n\nCharles Lock is one of an estimated 400 farmers who have remained in the country despite President Robert Mugabe's policy of redistributing white-owned farms to landless blacks.\n\n\n\n\"Why do they want to remove me when I've complied with everything they want? What more do they want other than for me to pack my bags and leave and if that's the case, then admit that that is the policy. Pass a law: no whites are allowed to farm. Then it makes it clear,\" Lock said.\n\n\n\nSince 2000, Mugabe's controversial land reform program has driven more than 4,000 commercial farmers off their land, destroying Zimbabwe's once prosperous agricultural sector.\n\n\n\n\"When the land reform program began, we decided we were not going to have a confrontational attitude; that we would actually go along with this program because it was the only way that this whole thing would be sorted out. So I voluntarily gave away my own farm and moved onto my father-in-law's farm,\" Lock said.\n\n\n\nThat was in 2002. A year later the government came knocking on his door again, he said, demanding more land.\n\n\n\nLock told CNN he eventually gave up 70 percent of his father-in-law's farm, which he then owned. Now an army general is demanding Lock's remaining 30 percent.\n\n\n\nWhen Zimbabwe's new unity government was formed -- with Mugabe's ZANU-PF and Morgan Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change -- in February this year, the general allegedly posted soldiers on Lock's farm. The farmer said he stopped farming and trade at gun point.\n\n\n\nWhen CNN visited Lock's farm this month, workers were standing idle. Maize and tobacco, which Lock said is worth more than U.S. $1 million, lay in storage.\n\n\n\n\"They've switched off our irrigation system, taken out keys and stop our trucks if we want to deliver maize,\" he told CNN.\n\n\n\nSo Lock had to sneak into his own property like a thief by cutting open the gate leading to his store room. He took a few valuables from his workshop suspecting that his whole place will soon be looted.\n\n\n\nWith the formation of a unity government farmers were hoping for some protection but Lock said: \"Nothing is happening here. There is no land audit happening, no one comes out here to check, to see. We are just left vulnerable.\"\n\n\n\nOn another farm, Ben Freeth's fight for his land has just escalated to another level.\n\n\n\nFreeth has been repeatedly beaten, arrested and harassed. Now his farmhouse and that of his father-in-law have been gutted by a mysterious fire. See the destruction the fire caused\n\n\n\nFreeth could not say for sure that this is arson but told CNN that the group of ZANU-PF youths who have occupied his farm have repeatedly threatened to burn his house.\n\n\n\n\"One time they came round with burning sacks at night and they started making a huge noise and ringing a great big bell and shouting and screaming. They were going underneath the thatch saying we are going to burn your house down if you don't get out,\" he said.\n\n\n\nFreeth and his father-in-law Mike Campbell are among a group of Zimbabwean farmers who won the right to remain on their land at a southern African tribunal.\n\n\n\nBut Mugabe has declared the ruling null and void and pulled out of the tribunal. Farmers cannot contest land issues in Zimbabwe and approaching international courts has thus far not worked either.\n\n\n\nWhen CNN interviewed Mugabe's minister of state, Didymas Mutasa, about the disregard for human and property rights on the farms, he blamed"}

It’s also a chance to learn skills that will serve them well working in intelligence, military technology, or even on the front lines of battle. While military academies aren’t every student’s ideal match, for those who want to pursue a career in the armed forces, they can be great training and preparation resources, teaching students how to ready both their bodies and minds for active service. Students who complete undergraduate programs at U.S. military academies may even have the option to pursue an online master’s degree in military history if they are interested in graduate study. \n Not all military academies are created equal, however, and some have a certain cachet that goes along with their names. While not a complete list (there are a lot of military academies out there, after all), we’ve tried to highlight some of the best, most rigorous, and most prestigious of these military academies in nations around the world. Read on to find out which schools are producing the best and brightest brass today. \n United States Military Academy , West Point, New York \n The USMA, better known as West Point, is perhaps one of the best and most prestigious military academies in the world. That reputation isn’t taken lightly. Students must not only apply to the school, but almost must receive a nomination from a U.S. Congressman (or woman) in order to be accepted, though non-U.S. citizens are allowed to apply. There is also a strict honor code, and students are expected to not only do well academically, but build military leadership and athletic skills. There is no tuition at West Point, but students must begin active duty with the Army upon graduation. Situated on a picturesque hill overlooking the Hudson River, the school itself is a national landmark and boasts some elite alumni including two presidents, many famous generals, and 74 recipients of the Medal of Honor. \n United States Naval Academy , Annapolis, Maryland \n The USNA was established in 1845, and has been educating officers for the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps ever since. Located on the former grounds of Fort Severn, the school’s campus is a national landmark and is within easy driving distance to Washington, D.C.

InvestorWords.com defines GDP as the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time, usually a calendar year.\n\nAccording to the U.N. survey, about a quarter of the earnings from opium go to farmers. The rest goes to district officials who collect taxes on the crop, to drug traffickers and to the insurgents and warlords who control the trade.\n\nAntonio Maria Costa, executive director of the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, urged NATO to take a more active role in countering the spread of the drug trade, which has increased dramatically since the American-led invasion to remove the hard-line Islamist government of the Taliban in October 2001.\n\n\"Since drugs are funding the insurgency, NATO has a self-interest in supporting Afghan forces in destroying drug labs, markets and convoys,\" Costa said in a written statement to coincide with the release of the survey. \"Destroy the drug trade and you cut off the Taliban's main funding source.\"\n\nJames Appathurai, a NATO spokesman, said coalition forces were equally concerned by the rapid growth in the narcotics trade.\n\n\"We share the U.N.'s concerns,\" Appathurai told CNN. \"Drugs not only poison people, but they poison economies and governments, and it is in everyone's interest to stop this proliferation.\"\n\nHe said NATO forces were providing assistance to Afghan police through training and transport but he said there were no plans to deploy coalition troops to intervene directly.\n\n\"The issue of whether we can do more is certainly a live discussion for NATO, but at the moment this is a matter for the Afghan government,\" Appathurai said.\n\nFarming of opium poppies has been almost eradicated in the north and west of the country, Appathurai said.\n\nHowever, he said, in the lawless southern provinces and especially in the Taliban stronghold of Helmand, poppy production was going on largely unchecked.\n\nAccording to the report, U.N. observers have noticed a proliferation of heroin labs in neighboring countries and along trafficking routes.\n\nCosta said the labs are dependent on precursor chemicals, like acetic anhydride, that must be smuggled into the region.\n\nHe called for tighter controls in chemical-producing countries and stronger intelligence-sharing between Afghanistan and its neighbors.\n\n\"Drug trafficking is a transnational threat, and therefore national initiatives have their limitations,\" the U.N. drug chief said.\n\nAppathurai said the most effective way to curb the drug trade was tackling the insurgency head-on. He also said it was important to provide alternative work for poor Afghan farmers to encourage them to give up opium production.\n\n\"You cannot have eradication in isolation. If we don't give them the support to produce alternative crops, then by wiping out their opium fields, you are only creating enemies for the future,\" he said. E-mail to a friend"}

Treatment not only increases oxygen levels in the patient's blood, but has the secondary effect of decreasing resistance to blood flow in many types of diseased lungs, easing work load on the heart. Oxygen therapy is used to treat emphysema, pneumonia, some heart disorders (congestive heart failure), some disorders that cause increased pulmonary artery pressure, and any disease that impairs the body's ability to take up and use gaseous oxygen."}

High Commissioner for Refugees on the matter. The UNHCR recommended against granting asylum, the spokeswoman said Wednesday.\n\nNo reason was given for the denial.\n\nIt was not immediately known what grounds bin Laden gave for his request, and the spokeswoman said it is unlikely to be disclosed.\n\nHis flight Monday originated in Cairo, Egypt, and landed in Madrid on its way to Casablanca, Morocco, she said. The request caught Spanish authorities by surprise, she said.\n\nBin Laden, who is married to a British citizen, previously was denied asylum in Britain.

{"question": "How many troops will be deployed?", "answers": ["30,000"], "context": "West Point, New York (CNN) -- President Obama said Tuesday that the deployment of 30,000 additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan is part of a strategy to reverse the Taliban's momentum and stabilize the country's government.\n\n\n\n\"There is no imminent threat of the government being overthrown, but the Taliban has gained momentum,\" Obama said at the U.S. Military Academy. \"Al Qaeda has not re-emerged in Afghanistan in the same numbers as before 9/11, but they retain their safe-havens along the border.\n\n\n\n\"And our forces lack the full support they need to effectively train and partner with Afghan security forces and better secure the population. ... In short, the status quo is not sustainable.\"\n\n\n\nObama said he'd begin sending the additional troops \"at the fastest pace possible\" starting in early 2010 \"with a goal of starting to withdraw forces from the country in July 2011.\"\n\n\n\nThe president said additional U.S. forces bolstered by NATO troops \"will allow us to accelerate handing over responsibility to Afghan forces.\"\n\n\n\nSenior administration officials said Tuesday that Obama has a goal of withdrawing most U.S. forces by the end of his current term, which ends in January 2013.\n\n\n\nWatch what the new troops will do in Afghanistan\n\n\n\nIt will be the second increase of U.S. forces in the war-torn Islamic country ordered by Obama since he took office in January.\n\n\n\nIn his speech Tuesday, Obama said his strategy had three objectives:\n\n\n\n• Deny al Qaeda a safe haven\n\n\n\n• Reverse the Taliban's momentum and deny it the ability to overthrow Afghanistan's government\n\n\n\n• Strengthen Afghanistan's security forces and government\n\n\n\nThe additional troops was one way to achieve these, he said. Other strategies will include holding Afghan government leaders accountable for corruption, focus assistance on areas that could help the lives of Afghans, and securing the country's border with Pakistan.\n\n\n\n\"We are in Afghanistan to prevent a cancer from once again spreading through that country. But this same cancer has also taken root in the border region of Pakistan. That is why we need a strategy that works on both sides of the border,\" Obama said.\n\n\n\nThe president said he rejected the option of committing more forces for an undefined mission of nation-building without any deadlines.\n\n\n\n\"I reject this course because it sets goals that are beyond what we can achieve at a reasonable cost, and what we need to achieve to secure our interests,\" Obama said. \"Furthermore, the absence of a timeframe for transition would deny us any sense of urgency in working with the Afghan government. It must be clear that Afghans will have to take responsibility for their security, and that America has no interest in fighting an endless war in Afghanistan.\"\n\n\n\nObama rejected analogies with the war in Vietnam that divided America in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n\n\n\"Unlike Vietnam, we are joined by a broad coalition of 43 nations that recognizes the legitimacy of our action,\" Obama said. \"Unlike Vietnam, we are not facing a broad-based popular insurgency. And most importantly, unlike Vietnam, the American people were viciously attacked from Afghanistan, and remain a target for those same extremists who are plotting along its border.\"\n\n\n\nObama said the U.S. has no interest in occupying Afghanistan.\n\n\n\n\"We will support efforts by the Afghan government to open the door to those Taliban who abandon violence and respect the human rights of their fellow citizens,\" Obama said. \"And we will seek a partnership with Afghanistan grounded in mutual respect -- to isolate those who destroy; to strengthen those who build; to hasten the day when our troops will leave; and to forge a lasting friendship in which America is your partner, and never your patron.\"\n\n\n\nObama spoke to an audience of West Point cadets, staff and guests in outlining his strategy that he has deliberated for months, meeting several times with his national security team.\n\n\n\nHe recognized that some in the audience had fought in Afghanistan, and some would be deployed in the future.\n\n\n\n\"As your commander in chief, I owe you a mission that is clearly defined, and worthy of"}

Neither the activities nor membership of the club are easy to ascertain.[3][4] \n The very first Hellfire Club was founded in London in 1719, by Philip, Duke of Wharton and a handful of other high society friends.[5] The most infamous club associated with the name was established in England by Sir Francis Dashwood,[6] and met irregularly from around 1749 to around 1760, and possibly up until 1766.[7] In its later years, the Hellfire was closely associated with Brooks's, established in 1764. Other clubs using the name \"Hellfire Club\" were set up throughout the 18th century. Most of these clubs were set up in Ireland after Wharton's were dispelled.[8] \n The club motto was Fais ce que tu voudras (Do what thou wilt), a philosophy of life associated with François Rabelais' fictional abbey at Thélème[7][9] and later used by Aleister Crowley. \n Duke of Wharton's club \n Philip, Duke of Wharton The neutrality of this section is disputed. Please see the discussion on the talk page. Please do not remove this message until the dispute is resolved. (July 2011) \n Lord Wharton, made a Duke by George I,[10] was a prominent politician with two separate lives: the first, \"a...man of letters\" and the second, \"...a drunkard, a rioter, an infidel and a rake\".[11] The members of Wharton's club are largely unknown. Blackett-Ord[12] assumes that members included Wharton's immediate friends: Earl of Hillsborough, cousin – the Earl of Lichfield and Sir Ed. O'Brien. Aside from these names, other members are not revealed. \n At the time of the London gentlemen's club, where there was a meeting place for every interest, including poetry, philosophy and politics,[13][14] Philip, Duke of Wharton's Hell-Fire Club was, according to Blackett-Ord,[15] a satirical \"gentlemans club\" which was known to ridicule religion, catching onto the then-current trend in England of blaspheming religion.[13][16] The club was more a joke, meant to shock the outside world, than a serious attack on religion or morality. The supposed president of this club was the Devil, although the members themselves did not apparently worship demons or the Devil, but called themselves devils.[17] Wharton's club admitted men and women as equals, unlike other clubs of the time.[16] The club met on Sundays at a number of different locations around London. The Greyhound Tavern was one of the meeting places used regularly, but because women were not to be seen in taverns, the meetings were also held at members' houses and at Wharton's riding club.[5][16][18] \n Despite rumours of devil worship and other dark arts being practised during the meetings, there is no evidence to prove this. According to a number of sources their activities included mock religious ceremonies and partaking in meals containing dishes like Holy Ghost Pie, Breast of Venus, and Devil's Loin, while drinking Hell-fire punch.[5][19] Members of the Club supposedly came to meetings dressed as characters from the Bible.[19] \n Wharton's club came to an end in 1721[16] when George I, under the influence of Wharton's political enemies (namely Robert Walpole) put forward a Bill \"against 'horrid impieties'\" (or immorality), aimed at the Hellfire Club.[2][20] Despite the fact that there has never been proof that Wharton's Hellfire Club ever did more than hold mock religious ceremonies and drink excessively, Wharton's political opposition used his membership as a way to pit him against his political allies, thus removing him from parliament.[20] After his Club was disbanded, Wharton became a Freemason, and in 1722 he became the Grandmaster of England.[21] \n Sir"}

Founded in May 1852, it was not until 1857 that the museum moved to the present site. This area of London was known as Brompton but had been renamed South Kensington. The land was occupied by Brompton Park House, which was extended, most notably by the \"Brompton Boilers\", which were starkly utilitarian iron galleries with a temporary look and were later dismantled and used to build the V&A Museum of Childhood. The first building to be erected that still forms part of the museum was the Sheepshanks Gallery in 1857 on the eastern side of the garden. Its architect was civil engineer Captain Francis Fowke, Royal Engineers, who was appointed by Cole. The next major expansions were designed by the same architect, the Turner and Vernon galleries built 1858-9 to house the eponymous collections (later transferred to the Tate Gallery) and now used as the picture galleries and tapestry gallery respectively. The North and South Courts, were then built, both of which opened by June 1862. They now form the galleries for temporary exhibitions and are directly behind the Sheepshanks Gallery.

Archeologist Betty Meggers was a prominent proponent of this idea, as described in her book Amazonia: Man and Culture in a Counterfeit Paradise. She claimed that a population density of 0.2 inhabitants per square kilometre (0.52/sq mi) is the maximum that can be sustained in the rainforest through hunting, with agriculture needed to host a larger population. However, recent anthropological findings have suggested that the region was actually densely populated. Some 5 million people may have lived in the Amazon region in AD 1500, divided between dense coastal settlements, such as that at Marajó, and inland dwellers.

{"question": "What did the A330-200 encounter?", "answers": ["heavy turbulence"], "context": "LONDON, England (CNN)  -- The mysterious disappearance of Flight AF 447 over the Atlantic Ocean has fueled speculation among aviation experts about what caused the state-of-the-art airliner to come down.\n\n\n\nAn airliner is struck by lightning strike at Washington's Dulles airport last year.\n\n\n\nAccording to Air France CEO Pierre-Henri Gourgeon, the Airbus A330-200 encountered heavy turbulence about 02:15 a.m. local time Monday (10:15 p.m. ET Sunday), three hours after the jet carrying 228 people left Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, for Paris, France.\n\n\n\nAt that point, the plane's automatic system initiated a four-minute exchange of messages to the company's maintenance computers, indicating \"several pieces of aircraft equipment were at fault or had broken down.\"\n\n\n\nThe jet, which was flying at 35,000 feet and at 521 mph, also sent a warning that it had lost pressure, the Brazilian air force said. Its last known contact occurred at 02:33 a.m., the Brazilian air force spokesman added.\n\n\n\nThe assumption is that these electrical problems led to a catastrophic failure of the aircraft's controls.  What brought Flight AF 447 down? »\n\n\n\nSome experts have said that a lightning strike was a possibility, particularly since the plane disappeared in a storm-prone area along the equator known as the Intertropical Convergence zone (ITCZ). This is where the trade winds of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres converge. The intense sun and warm water of the equator heats the air in the ITCZ, raising its humidity and making it buoyant. Aided by the convergence of the trade winds, the buoyant air rises, releasing the accumulated moisture in an almost constant series of thunderstorms.  The airliner's route »\n\n\n\nAccording to CNN's Mari Ramos, these storms can reach altitudes of 52,000 ft -- way beyond the capacity of commercial airliners to fly over.  Watch more about the weather systems »\n\n\n\nRetired airline pilot John Cox told CNN that modern aircraft receive a constant stream of real time weather data which allows them to plot a course around storms. \"Because safety is the paramount concern, airliners don't fly into storms. They fly around them,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"The ITCZ is no different. Planes fly through it every day.\n\n\n\n\"At 8 miles per minute, modern jets can easily fly around storms. Even if they encounter turbulence, they're designed to absorb it.\"\n\n\n\nWhen lightning strikes a plane, the bolt typically hits a sharp part of it, such as a wing tip. Huge amounts of energy surge through the aircraft before exiting out of another sharp point, such as the tail. But sometimes high voltages can cause electrical damage if components are not well-grounded.\n\n\n\nUnlike other aircraft where the pilot's controls are manually attached to the flaps and rudders, Airbus 330 airliners are equipped with a \"fly by wire\" system that sends electronic signals from an onboard computer to move key control surfaces.\n\n\n\nExperts say that it is possible for this system and its back-up computers to be disabled by lightning. \"If you have a massive electrical problem it's possible that you could cut off all the commands out to the control surfaces,\" said aeronautics expert John Hansman.\n\n\n\nHowever, Kieran Daly, from the online aviation news service Air Transport Intelligence, told CNN that this scenario, while not impossible, is inconceivable. \"It's more likely that lightning would cause a fire or punch a hole through the aircraft structure,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"It could be significant that the jet reported a loss of pressure.\"\n\n\n\nHe added that the aircraft would be able to continue without the fly-by-wire system.

The Skirmish of the Brick Church in 1862 just outside Jacksonville proper resulted in the first Confederate victory in Florida. In February 1864 Union forces left Jacksonville and confronted a Confederate Army at the Battle of Olustee resulting in a Confederate victory. Union forces then retreated to Jacksonville and held the city for the remainder of the war. In March 1864 a Confederate cavalry confronted a Union expedition resulting in the Battle of Cedar Creek.

He also may be considered the unluckiest player in FA Cup history. \n On this day 55 years ago, on January 28, 1961, Law scored six goals for Manchester City in a Fourth Round tie against second-tier Luton Town… and still ended up on the losing side. \n Playing under torrential rain and in ankle-deep mud, Law had managed to score all of City’s goals when the game was abandoned in the 69th minute due to the waterlogged pitch. The scoreline was subsequently wiped and the game rescheduled to start anew four days later. \n \"At the time, I was fairly relaxed about it,\" Law told the BBC Sport many years later. \"I was only young. I just thought, it doesn’t matter, we will beat them in the second game anyway.\" \n As it turned out, Law did score again in the replay, but this time City lost, 3-1.  \n Ouch! \n \"I never scored six in a game after that,\" Law recalled. \"The most I got was four, when I was at Manchester United. The only time I scored six was in a five-a-side game after I retired.\" \n \"Obviously it wasn’t meant to be. The funny thing was when we went for the replay on the Wednesday the pitch was in a worse state than it ever was on Saturday!\" \n Adding insult to injury, Law’s six goals were of wiped off the record books as well, eventually costing him the record for most FA Cup goals in the 20th century. The 1964 Ballon d’Or winner finished his career with 41 FA Cup goals, three shy of Ian Rush’s mark of 44. \n There was just one silver lining: Law would go on to win the competition just two seasons later with Manchester United.

{"question": "Who was the youngest person to become president of the USA?", "answers": ["theodore roosevelt"], "context": "Question - Youngest President of the United StatesQuestion - Youngest President of the United States \n By Martin Kelly \n Updated February 29, 2016. \n While many mistakenly say that John F. Kennedy was the youngest president of the United States, this is in error. He was the youngest president ever elected to the presidency at the age of 43. However, Theodore Roosevelt was the youngest man to serve as president when he took over after William McKinley's assassination . He was 42.  \n The founders of the Constitution decided that the age requirement to become a member of the House of Representatives should be 25, to become a Senator should be 30, and to become the president to be 35. One reason why this was the case was to make sure that individuals had the time to gain real world experience before leading the nation. In addition, there were no term limits set on the presidency until the passage of the 22nd amendment in 1947. Older presidents would not be able to stay in office quite as long, avoiding the appearance of a monarchical president. Finally, there was a belief that by the age of 35 individuals would have created a reputation for themselves on the national stage so that voters and electors would know ore about who they were electing as president. \n continue reading below our video \n What are the Seven Wonders of the World \n   \n Some question whether this age limit could be considered age discrimination. However, this issue is moot in that individuals who are even 40 years of age are often cited as being too young when they run for president. When President Obama ran for the presidency in 2008, he was 46 years old. Articles such as one written by one of John McCain's justice advisory committee members, Steven Calabresi, argued that he was still too young to serve as president. This despite the fact that he was 11 years old than he minimum required by the Constitution. However, in a poll taken during 2008, 13% of those polled stated that they thought he was too young to be president. The point of this is that in the United States, there is a perception that age is important in terms of gaining experience and reputation when being considered for the presidency.  \n Here are the ages of the ten youngest presidents to have served in the United States since its founding:  List of Presidents of the United States by ageThis is a list of United States Presidents by age. The first table charts the age of each United States President at the time of their presidential inauguration (first inauguration if they were elected to multiple and consecutive terms), at the time they left office, and at the time of their death. Each president's lifespan (age at death) is measured in two ways, to allow for the differing number of leap days that each experienced. The first figure is the number of days between date of birth and date of death, allowing for leap days; in parentheses the same period given in years and days, with the years being the number of whole years that the President lived, and the days being the number of days since the last birthday. Where the president is still living, lifespan is calculated up to . The second table is of those presidents who had the distinction among their peers of being the oldest living president, and charts both when they became and ceased to be oldest living. \n Overview \n The average age of accession is 54 years and 11 months, which falls between Herbert Hoover (22nd) and Lyndon B. Johnson (23rd). The youngest person to assume office was Theodore Roosevelt, who became president following William McKinley's assassination, at the age of .

But no one really thinks the North Koreans will launch an attack.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Nothing happened in 1994 when Kim Il Sung died and it will be the same this time.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe architect of what became known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in 1948 after the Korean peninsula was divided between U.S. and Soviet occupation forces, Kim Il Sung was an autocratic leader who presided over a policy of Juche, or self-reliance, which did much to foster the Communist country's isolation.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Kim Jong Il, his oldest son, succeeded him, North Korea was crippled economically, having lost one of its main trading partners when the Soviet Union collapsed. Kim largely ignored the massive problems at home and focused on shoring up the regime's position and investing in the military as a bulwark against the wealthy, U.S.-backed south.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat military hardware does North Korea have?\n\n\n\n\n\nBut with Kim dead, Choi believes many in the south will see this as an opportunity to improve relations with their dysfunctional neighbor, perhaps even paving the way for reunification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Most people, whether left or right on the political spectrum, hope this is the case,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"However a large chunk of South Koreans do worry about the financial burden of reunification, citing the case of West and East Germany in the early 1990s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Others argue the cost of living together will be a lot less than living separately in the long run. I also believe a whole host of issues could be resolved with reunification.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Choi said each generation in South Korea has its own viewpoint when it comes to relations with the north.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Those in their teens and 20s have a real fear of military conflict, as they are the ones who have to complete their compulsory military service,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Many people in their 30s and 40s worry about the financial cost to them of reunification, while those in their 50s and 60s back a united Korea whatever the cost.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIf reunification is a pipe dream for now, Choi says there is a difference of opinion in South Korea about the dynastic succession in the north.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Many people believe the transfer of power to a third generation is absurd, totally anachronistic and not what the world is about today,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But those who believe in a policy of engagement with North Korea say it doesn't matter whether it is third or fourth generation, they're still our people and we need to talk to them to try and resolve the situation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother view, according to Choi, is \"the Great Successor\" will not last long.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He's simply too young,\" he said.

Funded by donation & completed in 1897, it's located in Riverside Park, New York City, under the management of the National Park Service in 1958. The twin red granite sarcophagi of Grant & his wife are based on the sarcophagus of Napoleon.

Grant Genealogy and Family Tree - Thomas' LegionUS Grant Genealogy Tree Ulysses S Grant Ancestry Family Tree \n Family Tree and Genealogy \n   \n Grant’s parents were Jesse Root and Hannah Simpson                            Grant. Grant married Julia Dent in 1848. They had four children: Frederick Dent, Ulysses Simpson, Ellen Wrenshall, and Jesse                            Root. \n   \n At the age of 17, Grant entered the United States Military Academy (USMA)                            at West Point, New York, secured by Congressman Thomas L. Hamer's nomination. An opening had been made at USMA when a cadet                            from Georgetown resigned in October 1838. Hamer mistakenly nominated him as \"Ulysses S. Grant of Ohio.\" At West Point, he                            adopted this name with a middle initial only. His nickname became \"Sam\" among army colleagues at the academy, since the initials                            \"U.S.\" stood for \"Uncle Sam\". \n Many believe that Grant's true character was evident in his writing — especially in his personal letters to his beloved wife, Julia. \"His letters are marvels of composition and are mirrors of                            his sensitive soul.\" Grant's letters to his wife \"reveal his passions, sorrows and the loneliness that enveloped him like                            a shroud.\" \n Grant intensely loved his wife and children. Together, he and Julia had four                            children. Grant was reported to be an indulgent and affectionate father. He remained close to his wife and children throughout                            his life. In fact, his wife and youngest son stayed with him at his Civil War headquarters cabin at City Point, Virginia from                            December 1864 to March 1865. After the Union victory at Petersburg, he returned to City Point to retrieve his wife and son                            so they could return home together. His family stayed by his side during his final days as he battled throat cancer in 1885.                            Many attributed the cancer to his love of cigars; Grant was known to smoke at least 20 cigars daily. \n Terminally ill, Grant had finished his memoir just a few days before his death. The Memoirs sold over 300,000                            copies, earning the Grant family over $450,000. Mark Twain promoted the book as \"the most remarkable                            work of its kind since the Commentaries of Julius Caesar.\" Grant's memoir has been regarded by writers as diverse as Matthew                            Arnold and Gertrude Stein as one of the finest works of its kind ever written. \n Ulysses S. Grant died on Thursday, July 23, 1885, at the age of 63 in Mount                            McGregor, Saratoga County, New York. After lying in state, Grant's body was placed on a funeral train and traveled south from                            Albany, New York, and passed through the West Point station of Garrison, across the Hudson River from the Academy. \n   \n The train carrying Grant's body was draped in black and slowly passed on                            its way to New York City. As it passed through West Point the whole undergraduate battalion with Cadet Captain John J. Pershing                            at its head stood at present arms. Grant's body lies in New York City's Riverside Park, beside that of his wife, in Grant's                            Tomb, the largest mausoleum in North America. Grant is honored by the Ulysses S.

Nevertheless, socially the educated Chinese elite were in general not given the degree of esteem that they had been accorded previously under native Chinese dynasties. Although the traditional Chinese elite were not given their share of power, the Mongols and the Semuren (various allied groups from Central Asia and the western end of the empire) largely remained strangers to the mainstream Chinese culture, and this dichotomy gave the Yuan regime a somewhat strong \"colonial\" coloration. The unequal treatment is possibly due to the fear of transferring power to the ethnic Chinese under their rule. The Mongols and Semuren were given certain advantages in the dynasty, and this would last even after the restoration of the imperial examination in the early 14th century. In general there were very few North Chinese or Southerners reaching the highest-post in the government compared with the possibility that Persians did so in the Ilkhanate. Later the Yongle Emperor of the Ming dynasty also mentioned the discrimination that existed during the Yuan dynasty. In response to an objection against the use of \"barbarians\" in his government, the Yongle Emperor answered: \"... Discrimination was used by the Mongols during the Yuan dynasty, who employed only \"Mongols and Tartars\" and discarded northern and southern Chinese and this was precisely the cause that brought disaster upon them\"."}

{"question": "What dynasty shared artistic inspiration with the Yuan?", "answers": ["Song", "Song", "the Song dynasty"], "context": "In the China of the Yuan, or Mongol era, various important developments in the arts occurred or continued in their development, including the areas of painting, mathematics, calligraphy, poetry, and theater, with many great artists and writers being famous today. Due to the coming together of painting, poetry, and calligraphy at this time many of the artists practicing these different pursuits were the same individuals, though perhaps more famed for one area of their achievements than others. Often in terms of the further development of landscape painting as well as the classical joining together of the arts of painting, poetry, and calligraphy, the Song dynasty and the Yuan dynasty are linked together. In the area of Chinese painting during the Yuan dynasty there were many famous painters. In the area of calligraphy many of the great calligraphers were from the Yuan dynasty era. In Yuan poetry, the main development was the qu, which was used among other poetic forms by most of the famous Yuan poets. Many of the poets were also involved in the major developments in the theater during this time, and the other way around, with people important in the theater becoming famous through the development of the sanqu type of qu. One of the key factors in the mix of the zaju variety show was the incorporation of poetry both classical and of the newer qu form. One of the important cultural developments during the Yuan era was the consolidation of poetry, painting, and calligraphy into a unified piece of the type that tends to come to mind when people think of classical Chinese art. Another important aspect of Yuan times is the increasing incorporation of the then current, vernacular Chinese into both the qu form of poetry and the zaju variety show. Another important consideration regarding Yuan dynasty arts and culture is that so much of it has survived in China, relatively to works from the Tang dynasty and Song dynasty, which have often been better preserved in places such as the Shōsōin, in Japan."}

While Nemcova survived by clinging to a palm tree for eight hours, her long-term partner did not.\n\n\n\nHere, Nemcova shows CNN around Prague and tells of her love for the \"Golden City,\" what she learnt from growing up in a communist country and how she keeps smiling -- despite life's setbacks.\n\n\n\nCNN: Tell us about the first time you came to Prague.\n\n\n\nPetra Nemcova: The first time was to visit my aunt and even if Prague is in the same country as my town, it felt like a real journey. For us it was like going somewhere very special, far away, because under the Communist regime you didn't travel that much and Prague was \"wow.\"\n\n\n\nI was overwhelmed and amazed by the beauty of Prague and every time I arrive in Prague, even now, I'm still amazed. The lighting at night; the incredible architecture; the details; the history; there was a lot to learn about and a lot to discover. It was a very special experience.\n\n\n\nThe following time I went to Prague was during my early career in the fashion industry and I was traveling once, twice a week from my town to Prague. I would wake up at 5.45 in the morning, take the bus for one hour, then a tram to school. After school I would take a five-hour train to Prague. So it was quite intense at that time, but it was a great experience and it taught me a lot about being independent.\n\n\n\nCNN: How would you describe Prague, in five words?\n\n\n\nPetra Nemcova: Prague is a city of romance, of incredible architecture and history. Some people call it the \"golden city,\" some people say it's the heart of Europe -- although maybe the French don't like that very much! Paris is bigger obviously and a bit more hectic and Prague is smaller and has more of a village-y feeling compared to Paris. Prague has more of a calming vibe. It's not rush-rush-rush.\n\n\n\nI think when people come here they are surprised by the beauty of Prague and also the vivid colors. I think they may imagine Prague more in gray colors because of the communist association. But since then a lot of reconstruction has been done. Before Prague was shades of grey and black, which was quite mysterious, but now it's more happy and pretty.\n\n\n\nIn five words it's historical, inspirational, creative, romantic and beautiful.\n\n\n\nCNN: What was your childhood like?\n\n\n\nPetra Nemcova: Growing up in the Czech Republic -- at the time Czechoslovakia -- was a beautiful childhood because I didn't understand the whole concept of communism. I was only 11 when communism fell down and when the Velvet Revolution happened. I had a really beautiful childhood ... I didn't have the great luxury things, we had very little and we counted every penny. But our parents gave us something more valuable than money -- they gave us so much love and that's priceless.\n\n\n\nWe didn't get the opportunity to travel all over the world and were able to travel only within the communist countries. So we went around our country to see different castles, little towns and I loved it. So that made us richer. It also made us appreciate nature because we spent every weekend in nature. And the values you learn there are priceless too. You don't step on flowers, kick on mushrooms, you really respect nature.\n\n\n\nAnd the value of appreciation came from not having anything and then having a little bit. Having a clementine for Christmas -- it was an incredible joy and every time I smell a clementine, it brings me back to my childhood.\n\n\n\nBut it was harder for my parents."}

Eight years ago there were no golf courses but --to fulfil the increasing domestic demand and as a means to attract tourists to the region -- the country could be set for a  boom in golf development.\n\n\n\nKancho Stoychev, vice president of Bulgarian Golf, believes that despite there being only 200 registered players in a country whose population is eight million there is set to be an explosion of interest in the sport.\n\n\n\nSee CNN's Justin Armsden's report on the development of golf in Eastern Europe. »\n\n\n\n\"It is an absurdly low figure, but now I believe that there'll be a switch because we have six nice golf courses,\" Stoychev told CNN.\n\n\n\n\"We can already see there is a high increase in interest and it'll evolve quite quickly.\n\n\n\n\"We have some advantages in Bulgaria. We have an excellent coastlines, we are a small country but very diverse, so the country is geographically and naturally perfect for golf.\"\n\n\n\nThe potential in Eastern Europe has also been recognized by golf legend Gary Player, whose course design company has been working on projects in the region.\n\n\n\nHaving just opened a course in Poland, Player's design company is building two more in Bulgaria - BlackSeaRama which is already open, and Thracian Cliffs which is scheduled to be finished by July 2010.\n\n\n\nPlayer told CNN: \"You want to take golf to new areas, like Poland, you want to bring it to Bulgaria, where people never thought that they could play golf where people associated golf with just rich people.\n\n\n\n\"You can play down here along the ocean and ten minutes up the mountain you have a links course, which is the complete opposite, people who love golf will be in for a golfing treat.\"\n\n\n\nThe knock-on effect of the presence of a high-profile name such as Player in the region ensures it has caught the eye of influential figures within the industry.\n\n\n\nRyan Lauder, director of marketing at TaylorMade added: \"Eastern Europe is coming along, although there is still not the number of golfers or golf courses that we have in Western Europe, looking to the future it is a great opportunity for us.\""}

{"question": "What other terminology is considered much more destructive?", "answers": ["civil rebellion", "rebellion", "civil rebellion are justified by appeal to constitutional defects, rebellion is much more", "rebellion", "rebellion"], "context": "There have been debates as to whether civil disobedience must necessarily be non-violent. Black's Law Dictionary includes non-violence in its definition of civil disobedience. Christian Bay's encyclopedia article states that civil disobedience requires \"carefully chosen and legitimate means,\" but holds that they do not have to be non-violent. It has been argued that, while both civil disobedience and civil rebellion are justified by appeal to constitutional defects, rebellion is much more destructive; therefore, the defects justifying rebellion must be much more serious than those justifying disobedience, and if one cannot justify civil rebellion, then one cannot justify a civil disobedients' use of force and violence and refusal to submit to arrest.

Writer Anthony Coburn, story editor David Whitaker and initial producer Verity Lambert also heavily contributed to the development of the series.[note 1] The programme was originally intended to appeal to a family audience, as an educational programme using time travel as a means to explore scientific ideas and famous moments in history. On 31 July 1963 Whitaker commissioned Terry Nation to write a story under the title The Mutants. As originally written, the Daleks and Thals were the victims of an alien neutron bomb attack but Nation later dropped the aliens and made the Daleks the aggressors. When the script was presented to Newman and Wilson it was immediately rejected as the programme was not permitted to contain any \"bug-eyed monsters\". The first serial had been completed and the BBC believed it was crucial that the next one be a success, but The Mutants was the only script ready to go, so the show had little choice but to use it. According to producer Verity Lambert; \"We didn't have a lot of choice — we only had the Dalek serial to go ... We had a bit of a crisis of confidence because Donald [Wilson] was so adamant that we shouldn't make it. Had we had anything else ready we would have made that.\" Nation's script became the second Doctor Who serial – The Daleks (a.k.a. The Mutants). The serial introduced the eponymous aliens that would become the series' most popular monsters, and was responsible for the BBC's first merchandising boom."}

{"question": "Why are food allergies on the rise?", "answers": ["no one is sure"], "context": "(CNN) -- Since 2½-year-old Ava Zinna ended up in the emergency room  this summer after an allergic reaction to peanuts, her mother, Tara, has worried about her daughter's food whenever they eat out. But when the family went to Blue Smoke restaurant Sunday afternoon in New York, someone had already asked to hold the peanuts.\n\n\n\nAva Zinna ate an allergen-free meal at the Worry Free Dinners event on Sunday.\n\n\n\nThe Zinnas took part in Worry Free Dinners, a series of monthly meals for people with food allergies. Sunday's 16-person barbecue -- complete with ribs, chicken, burgers and brownies -- was the first event aimed directly at parents and children affected by food allergies.\n\n\n\n\"When you're going into a restaurant environment, you're putting your child's safety and livelihood into other hands,\" Tara Zinna said. At the Worry Free Dinners event, \"not only was the food phenomenal, but it's wonderful to have an opportunity to interact with other families who are dealing with similar issues.\"\n\n\n\nThe recent \"worry free\" meal event took place just days before the Food and Drug Administration's September 16 public hearing on food ingredient labels. Since 2006, food manufacturers have been required to clearly label products that contain any of the most common allergens -- milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, peanuts, tree nuts, wheat and soy -- but some allergy experts say the labels should be more explicit.\n\n\n\nRestaurant dining can be a terrifying experience for people with severe food allergies. When the meal arrives, there's often no way of knowing every single ingredient that went into it, or what else touched the plate and utensils used to serve it. You also have to pester the restaurant staff with special requests.\n\n\n\nBut with Worry Free Dinners, everyone has some kind of experience with all of that, which helps build camaraderie, said Sloane Miller, who started organizing the events in April.  Read more tips on how to manage food allergies »\n\n\n\n\"People sit down and start chatting immediately like they're old friends,\" said Miller, known in the blogosphere as \"Allergic Girl.\" \"It's so nice to be with people that you don't have to explain [to] why you want something on the side.\"\n\n\n\nSo far, Worry Free Dinners has catered to food allergy sufferers in New York -- there are about 12 million in America, according to the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network (FAAN) -- but Miller is looking to take the concept to other cities.\n\n\n\nA common but mysterious condition\n\n\n\nOne out of every 17 children under 3 years old in America has a food allergy, and some will outgrow their sensitivities, said Anne Munoz-Furlong, founder and CEO of FAAN. But allergies to peanuts, nuts, shellfish and fish tend to be lifelong, she said. As far as she knows, Worry Free Dinners is the first event series of its kind.\n\n\n\nExperts agree that allergies in general -- both food and inhalant -- are on the rise, but no one is sure why. Research on food allergies has been slow because \"for a long time, people thought this was a small problem,\" Munoz-Furlong said. The largest group of studies on the subject are in progress, including immunotherapy for people with peanut and milk allergies, she said.\n\n\n\nThe majority of food allergy cases -- about 80 percent -- are \"cyclic,\" with mild symptoms that resemble those of pollen or dust allergies: sneezing, itchy eyes, and nasal congestion, said Dr. Alpen Patel, assistant professor of otolaryngology at Emory University. Other people experience nausea, vomiting and diarrhea consistently in response to certain foods.\n\n\n\nBut for some people, ingesting something that even accidentally touched tree nuts or peanuts could result in anaphylaxis, a severe reaction that can lead to blocked airways, cardiovascular collapse, and even death. This is called a \"fixed food allergy,\" he said.\n\n\n\nAfter one severe reaction, he said, most people consistently avoid the offending food and do not experience another severe attack. But they also always carry a shot of epinephrine to"}

The climate is cooler in the savannah grasslands around the capital city, Nairobi, and especially closer to Mount Kenya, which has snow permanently on its peaks. Further inland, in the Nyanza region, there is a hot and dry climate which becomes humid around Lake Victoria, the largest tropical fresh-water lake in the world.

The north-eastern regions along the border with Somalia and Ethiopia are arid and semi-arid areas with near-desert landscapes. Kenya is known for its safaris, diverse climate and geography, and expansive wildlife reserves and national parks such as the East and West Tsavo National Park, the Maasai Mara, Lake Nakuru National Park, and Aberdares National Park.

{"question": "who campaign helped fortunes soar?", "answers": ["Obama's"], "context": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Barack Obama's victory Tuesday over John McCain capped an unprecedented rise in American politics.\n\n\n\n\n\nBarack Obama, addressing supporters after his victory, was an unlikely nominee not that long ago.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe obscure state legislator with, as he put it, \"a funny name\" propelled himself onto the national stage at the Democratic National Convention four years ago with a speech so electrifying that commentators declared he would become America's first black president.\n\n\n\n\n\nElection Day showed that, in this case at least, you can believe the hype. But Obama did not win the White House on hype, any more than he won it on hope.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe won it with an organization that even opponents called brilliant. He won it with a clear strategy that was stuck to with remarkably little internal drama. He won it with unparalleled fundraising and an overwhelming ground game. And he won it after facing various challenges and turning them to his advantage.\n\n\n\n\n\nTurning points\n\n\n\n\n\nWinning Iowa: Obama's victory in the Iowa caucuses knocked almost all of his Democratic competitors out in the first nominating contest, and it pushed the \"inevitable\" Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, back on her heels. He'd built an organization strong enough to haul supporters out of their homes on a frigid January night to debate, harangue and cajole their neighbors into backing him. Tens of thousands of new voters became the key to his Iowa win and revealed the outline of a general election plan: Create a wide coalition to bring new voters to the polls in record numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\nTed Kennedy: Within weeks of Iowa, all of Obama's Democratic competitors had dropped out of the race except for Clinton, who split the races with him in the run-up to Super Tuesday. It was then that Ted Kennedy, head of the only Democratic family to outrank the Clintons, came out for Obama, comparing the Illinois senator to his assassinated brother, President John F. Kennedy. The move was deeply symbolic, not just for the public but also the party. The Obama-Clinton battle then hinged on who could sway more superdelegates -- the party leaders who could decide the winner if the primary voters could not -- and few superdelegates had the stature of Ted Kennedy.\n\n\n\n\n\nAddressing race: Race was always going to be a factor in Obama's campaign, even if he hoped his candidacy would transcend it. Clips of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, his longtime pastor, making hateful remarks hit the Internet and television and put Obama on defense. He responded with a speech in March hailed by commentators as among the most thoughtful ever delivered on race by an American politician. When Wright went further, so did Obama -- condemning him outright and later quitting his church. All this time, black voters were rallying behind Obama, switching their allegiance from Clinton in such large numbers that party elders, such as civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, had to do the same.\n\n\n\n\n\nFundraising: Flush with cash from a nationwide network of small and large contributors, Obama announced in June he would opt out of public financing -- the first presidential candidate to pay for his campaign with donations rather than government money since the system began in 1976. McCain hammered Obama for reneging on a promise to stick with public financing, but the issue failed to resonate with voters. Obama kept raising and spending record amounts of money, using it to send staff across the country -- even to dozens of states Democrats hadn't won in years -- and to swamp the airwaves with advertising.\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking with Clinton: The long and bitter primary battle turned many Clinton supporters off Obama. A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll a month after Obama sealed the nomination found that nearly 50 percent of Clinton's supporters did not plan to vote for Obama in November. McCain tried to exploit the Democrats' divisions and attract Clinton supporters to his side, but the former rivals came together to stop that. Obama and Clinton worked behind the scenes to create a show of public unity, epitomized by Clinton dramatically marching onto the convention floor in Denver to call for the party to nominate Obama by acclamation.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe debates: Obama won all three debates"}
{"question": "What company initiated the investigation into Intel?", "answers": ["AMD, a competitor, launched this in Europe (and in Japan and South Korea)"], "context": "(CNN) -- The European Commission handed down its ruling in a landmark anti-trust case against Intel Wednesday, fining the computer chip giant a record  $1.45 billion for abusing its dominant position in the computer processing unit (CPU) market.\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday the European Commission fined Intel a record $1.45 billion for violating anti-trust laws.\n\n\n\nThe ruling, which Intel plans to appeal, may have future implications for American companies accused of \"jurisdiction shopping\" to avoid anti-trust verdicts against them, says CNN's Jim Boulden, who explains the basics of the Intel case.\n\n\n\nThe commission has hit Intel with the biggest fine ever -- what were its reasons?\n\n\n\nThe European Commission says Intel has been abusing its dominant market position in semiconductors for years. The EC says Intel has systematically given PC makers and stores rebates to keep computers with AMD chips off the shelves. AMD (another American company and Intel's only competitor) first raised the red flag in 2000.\n\n\n\nWhy does the commission have the power to impose such fines?\n\n\n\nEU law does not regard market dominance as illegal, but it is allowed to fine a company that abuses its position as the biggest in any given market. It has a guideline of fining a company based on a percentage of profits.\n\n\n\nEU law is set up to \"protect consumers,\" and the anti-trust office says consumers were hurt. Yet as Intel likes to point out, consumers did not launch this case -- AMD, a competitor, launched this in Europe (and in Japan and South Korea) as the U.S. antitrust officials under George W. Bush were unlikely to pursue a case on these merits.\n\n\n\nThe EU could fine Intel (or any company) based on 10% of global annual revenues, but chose to fine it on a smaller percentage made in the EU.\n\n\n\nCan Intel afford to pay this fine? What state is the company in at the moment?\n\n\n\nIntel reported first quarter revenue of $7 billion. It can easily afford this. Interestingly, it lost 4 percent of its market share to AMD so far this year.\n\n\n\nThe company says it will appeal -- when is that likely to be heard?\n\n\n\nAnother appeal will take months. Intel already appealed a preliminary part of this ruling last year and lost. Meanwhile, the EC can argue that Intel is still abusing its position and increase the fine during the appeals process, as it did to Microsoft.\n\n\n\nIntel is not the first tech company to be hit by the European Commission. What about Microsoft?\n\n\n\nThe anti-trust unit has launched another round of investigations against Microsoft. It has already paid its fine and the EU continues to watch the company's behavior on the previous matters.\n\n\n\nWhat kind of precedent does the Intel case set?\n\n\n\nThe EU has fined all kinds of cartels and market abusers, but rarely does it fine big American companies based on complaints from American competitors -- so the case catches the eye, especially with critics who accuse American companies of \"jurisdiction shopping\" to get a favorable outcome."}

{"question": "What level is the Mongolian?", "answers": ["most successful ever grand champion,"], "context": "(CNN) -- Asashoryu stands at the pinnacle of sumo wrestling like a colossus.\n\n\n\nAsashoryu is one of sumo's most successful, and most controversial, wrestlers.\n\n\n\nBut the 330-lbs Mongolian, sumo's most successful ever grand champion, has not been able to rise above the scandals and tragedies that have beset Japan's national sport in recent years.\n\n\n\nAsashoryu, whose real name is Dolgorsuren Dagvadorj, grew up in Mongolia, where both his elder brothers and father were successful wrestlers.\n\n\n\nMoving to Japan as a student he was spotted and trained by the Takesago stable and made his professional debut at the age of 18 in 1999.\n\n\n\nWinning his first tournament, or basho, in 2002, his rise up the rankings culminated in him attaining the highest position of Grand Champion, or yokozuna, in January 2003, becoming only the 68th yokozuna in the sport's 2,000-year-old history.\n\n\n\nTwo years later, he set a new record by being the only man to win all six official tournaments in one year.\n\n\n\nWhile Asashoryu's meteoric rise to the top was seen by many as reinvigorating a sport that had seen a decline in homegrown wrestlers and popularity, his success in the dohyo has not pleased everyone.\n\n\n\nSome have complained that his wins are too routine, and purists grouse that he does not poses the quality of \"hinkaku,\" the dignity and calm expected in a yokozuna, or give the sport's traditions the necessary respect.\n\n\n\nIn 2003 he was disqualified from a bout for pulling on the top-knot of an opponent, and has gained a reputation as the enfant-terrible of sumo.\n\n\n\nRegardless of the criticisms of Asashoryu's wrestling style, sumo's reputation as a noble sport of tradition has suffered from a number of scandals in recent years and exposed it as just as susceptible to the problems faced by other sports.\n\n\n\nWith deep links to Japanese culture going back to when sumo was part of the Shinto religious rituals, the sport's troubles have almost represented a national identity crisis.\n\n\n\nFollowing the banning of three non-Japanese wrestlers for using recreational drugs in September, the sport's chairman and former-wrestler Kitanoumi resigned.\n\n\n\nIt came after a period of years in which a number of match-fixing allegations were made, some directly implicating Asashoryu, and plunging the sport into yet another crisis.\n\n\n\nIn January 2007 he was accused of bribing other wrestlers to lose bouts, compounding the view that corruption was prevalent in the sport.\n\n\n\nProblems for Asashoryu continued in 2007 when he was suspended by the sumo wrestling federation for allegedly faking a doctor's note and was restricted from leaving his house in Tokyo, leading to reports of a nervous breakdown.\n\n\n\nMental as well as physical strength are necessary to reach the top of the sport, but while the punishing physical routine and \"hazing\" in the training stables has been known and accepted, tragedy struck earlier this year.\n\n\n\nTakashi Saito, a 17-year-old sumo trainee, died in brutal circumstances, allegedly beaten to death by his stable-master and three fellow sumo wrestlers.\n\n\n\nContinuing to make his mark in the dohyo will be Asashoryu's aim for the rest of the year, while sumo hopes it can recover its own poise."}

(In addition to selling GE computers, the centers were computer service bureaus, offering batch processing services. They lost money from the beginning, and Sinback, a high-level marketing manager, was given the job of turning the business around. He decided that a time-sharing system, based on Kemney's work at Dartmouth—which used a computer on loan from GE—could be profitable. Warner was right.)"}
{"question": "What does the expert patrol?", "answers": ["the Florida Keys,"], "context": "THE EVERGLADES, Florida (CNN) -- Joe Wasilewski drives along a narrow stretch of road through Florida's Everglades. The sun is setting, night is coming on quickly, and Wasilewski is on the prowl for snakes -- and one snake in particular.\n\n\n\nReptile expert Joe Wasilewski holds a Burmese python he found in the Florida Everglades.\n\n\n\n\"The next 10 miles seem to be the hot spot for Burmese pythons,\" he said.\n\n\n\nWasilewski is a state-sanctioned snake-hunter who regularly scours this area for the reptiles. The Everglades, known as the River of Grass, has the perfect space and climate for pythons to hide and breed.\n\n\n\nAnd breed they do: The largest clutches found in the Everglades have contained 83 eggs.\n\n\n\nThey are also speedy travelers, able to move across 1.6 miles of land every day, experts say.\n\n\n\nThe travel lets people like Wasilewski hunt the snakes from the driver's seat of his truck. But it also means that the problems created in the local ecosystem by the non-venomous snakes are spreading.\n\n\n\n\"It's a large predator, and they're eating basically everything in sight. That's the problem,\" Wasilewski said of the Burmese python.\n\n\n\nVolunteers like Wasilewski, happy to grasp the problem and the snakes with both hands, are not the only troops in Florida's war on the invading pythons.\n\n\n\nA \"Python Patrol\" was launched in the Florida Keys, south of the Everglades, by Alison Higgins of the Nature Conservancy. Her program uses utility workers, wildlife officials, park rangers and police to keep an eye out for snakes and trains them to capture any they find.\n\n\n\n\"The Burmese pythons that are coming out of the Everglades are eating a lot of our endangered species and other creatures, and we want to make sure they don't breed here,\" said Higgins, the conservation manager for the Keys.\n\n\n\nIt is believed that the problem originated when reptile-breeding facilities near the Everglades were destroyed during Hurricane Andrew. Compounding the problem is the release of these snakes by pet owners.\n\n\n\n\"These pets were released by owners that do not understand the threat to the ecosystem,\" Everglades National Park spokeswoman Linda Friar said. She said the pets, which can grow to 200 pounds and live for 30 years, often get too big for owners to handle.\n\n\n\nThe state has a pilot program with several volunteer snake hunters such as Wasilewski.\n\n\n\nTwenty years ago, no Burmese pythons were found in the Everglades, park statistics say. Now, there could be 100,000 snakes in the River of Grass, but no one knows for sure.\n\n\n\nWhat Wasilewski, an expert on reptiles, is sure of is that night is the best time for his hunting, as that is when the snakes tend to be on the move.\n\n\n\nWhen he finds his prey, he puts the snake in a bag, deposits it in a crate and delivers it to biologists for the Everglades National Park, where the snake can be studied and/or destroyed.\n\n\n\nOn one recent evening, the pickings were slim, and after two hours of driving back and forth along the two-lane Tamiami Trail, Wasilewski's crate was empty. He saw a python on the road, but it was dead, and the other small snakes and a baby alligator in the area did not interest him.\n\n\n\nFinally, Wasilewski, an environmental and wildlife consultant, spotted something. \"Yeah, baby! Hee ha! Look at the size of this one,\" he exclaimed from the front seat of his truck.\n\n\n\nHe got out and picked up the brownish-green snake, which immediately coiled around his arm.\n\n\n\n\"This isn't a big one,\" he said, but as he got a closer look, he did not deny that it was a good one: \"At least 12 [feet.]\"\n\n\n\nWasilewski has a soft spot for these species, and one of the reasons he volunteers for the snake hunt is to learn more about them.\n\n\n\nHe says it is not the snakes' fault that they ended up in the Everglades, but he"}

Saying that a problem is not in P does not imply that all large cases of the problem are hard or even that most of them are. For example, the decision problem in Presburger arithmetic has been shown not to be in P, yet algorithms have been written that solve the problem in reasonable times in most cases. Similarly, algorithms can solve the NP-complete knapsack problem over a wide range of sizes in less than quadratic time and SAT solvers routinely handle large instances of the NP-complete Boolean satisfiability problem."}

{"question": "Who presented Family Fortunes in the two years between Bob Monkhouse and Les Dennis?", "answers": ["max bygraves"], "context": "Learn and talk about Family Fortunes, 1980 British ...Learn and talk about Family Fortunes, 1980 British television programme debuts, 1980s British television series, 1990s British television series, 2000s British television series \n All Star Family Fortunes \n Family Fortunes is a British television game show based on the American game show Family Feud . The programme ran on ITV from 6 January 1980 to 6 December 2002, before being revived by the same channel in 2006 under the title of All Star Family Fortunes . The game involves two families providing answers to 'everyday questions' that were surveyed by 100 members of the British public before the show (e.g. 'Name something usually done in the dark') to win cash prizes (and sometimes mystery prizes for giving a correct answer). The top answers to the surveys are displayed on a large electronic board, originally known as \"Mr. Babbage\", which famously sounds a wrong answer \"Eh-uhh\" sound effect and its accompanying X to signal the strike, as well as a \"ding\" for a right answer). \n Contents \n 11 External links \n Hosts and presentation[ edit ] \n Family Fortunes was first hosted by comedian Bob Monkhouse (1980–83) then by singer and entertainer Max Bygraves (1983–85). After being rested for the whole of 1986, the show returned on 27 June 1987 with Les Dennis as presenter, and had a consistently successful run for the next 15 years. It was then moved out of peak time and became a daily daytime show, hosted by Andy Collins , but it only had a short run in this format before being axed. \n In 2006, the series was revived with Vernon Kay as host, and was renamed All Star Family Fortunes , as each team consisted of a celebrity and four family members. The show was also transmitted back to peak time. Prize money goes to a charity of the celebrity's choice, and contestants being either celebrity families, or a group of actors famous for playing a fictional family. Several Christmas specials of All Star Family Fortunes have aired as well. \n The most iconic aspects of the show are the large computer screen, named \"Mr Babbage\" by original host Bob Monkhouse and the famous computerised \"Eh-uhh\" sound used when wrong answers are given. Both were originally designed to appear high-tech but have since become fondly regarded for being quite the opposite (as compared to the original US Feud, which has used a video board since its 1999 revival). The computer screen name \"Mr Babbage\" was in recognition to the English mathematician, philosopher, inventor, and mechanical engineer who originated the concept of a programmable computer, Charles Babbage . \n Format[ edit ] \n Two family teams, each with five members, are asked to guess the results of surveys, in which 100 people would be asked open ended questions (e.g. \"we asked 100 people to name something associated with the country Wales\" or \"we asked 100 people to name a breed of dog\"). Although rarely acknowledged in the show, the 100 people surveyed are invariably audience members who have volunteered before the show. \n Each round begins with a member of each family (in rotation, meaning all players do this at least once) approaching the podium. As the question is read, the first of the two nominees to hit a buzzer gives an answer. If this is not the most popular answer, the other nominee is asked. The family with the more popular answer then chooses whether to \"play\" the question, or \"pass\" control to the other family. \n The host then passes down the line of the controlling team, asking for an answer from each. After each answer, the board reveals whether this answer featured. If not, the family is assessed a strike, and the family loses control of the board after accumulating three strikes (also referred as striking out) in the round. If a family manages to come up with all the survey answers (most commonly six in the early part of the show, reduced in number after the commercial break) before striking out, they win the amount in pounds of the total"}

{"question": "What does Graham Twigg propose about the spread of disease?", "answers": ["a form of anthrax", "was a form of anthrax", "the cause was a form of anthrax"], "context": "A variety of alternatives to the Y. pestis have been put forward. Twigg suggested that the cause was a form of anthrax, and Norman Cantor (2001) thought it may have been a combination of anthrax and other pandemics. Scott and Duncan have argued that the pandemic was a form of infectious disease that characterise as hemorrhagic plague similar to Ebola. Archaeologist Barney Sloane has argued that there is insufficient evidence of the extinction of a large number of rats in the archaeological record of the medieval waterfront in London and that the plague spread too quickly to support the thesis that the Y. pestis was spread from fleas on rats; he argues that transmission must have been person to person. However, no single alternative solution has achieved widespread acceptance. Many scholars arguing for the Y. pestis as the major agent of the pandemic suggest that its extent and symptoms can be explained by a combination of bubonic plague with other diseases, including typhus, smallpox and respiratory infections. In addition to the bubonic infection, others point to additional septicemic (a type of \"blood poisoning\") and pneumonic (an airborne plague that attacks the lungs before the rest of the body) forms of the plague, which lengthen the duration of outbreaks throughout the seasons and help account for its high mortality rate and additional recorded symptoms. In 2014, scientists with Public Health England announced the results of an examination of 25 bodies exhumed from the Clerkenwell area of London, as well as of wills registered in London during the period, which supported the pneumonic hypothesis."}

Their host organisms are commonly known as the green algae and land plants. They differ from glaucophyte and red algal chloroplasts in that they have lost their phycobilisomes, and contain chlorophyll b instead. Most green chloroplasts are (obviously) green, though some aren't, like some forms of Hæmatococcus pluvialis, due to accessory pigments that override the chlorophylls' green colors. Chloroplastidan chloroplasts have lost the peptidoglycan wall between their double membrane, and have replaced it with an intermembrane space. Some plants seem to have kept the genes for the synthesis of the peptidoglycan layer, though they've been repurposed for use in chloroplast division instead."}

The company first constructed a new 10-story building on land previously occupied by an abandoned warehouse on the corner of Columbus Avenue and West 66th Street; the facility that was built in its place is nicknamed \"7 Lincoln Square\" (although it is actually located at 149 Columbus Avenue).

{"question": "Who spoke in favor of judge's confirmation?", "answers": ["Arkansas Attorney General Dustin McDaniel testified on Sotomayor's behalf,"], "context": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- New Haven, Connecticut, firefighter Frank Ricci, the lead plaintiff in perhaps the most controversial case involving Judge Sonia Sotomayor, said Thursday that Sotomayor's rejection of his reverse discrimination claim had undermined the concept of a merit-based civil service system.\n\n\n\nNew Haven firefighter Frank Ricci sued after the city threw out results of a 2003 firefighter promotion exam.\n\n\n\nRicci was one of a group of 20 mostly white firefighters who sued the city of New Haven after it threw out the results of a 2003 firefighter promotion exam because almost no minorities qualified for promotions.\n\n\n\nThe 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals, including Sotomayor, backed the city in the 2008 case Ricci v. DeStefano. The ruling of the Circuit Court was overturned in June by a 5-4 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n\n\nThe \"belief that citizens should be reduced to racial statistics is flawed,\" Ricci told the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\n\n\n\"It only divides people who don't wish to be divided along racial lines. The very reason we have civil service rules is to root out politics, discrimination and nepotism. Our case demonstrates that these ills will exist if the rules of merit and the law are not followed.\"  Watch firefighters testify »\n\n\n\nRicci also criticized Sotomayor's 2nd Circuit for disposing of the case in an \"unsigned, unpublished summary order that consisted of a single paragraph.\"\n\n\n\nSotomayor was not present when Ricci spoke. She left the session after concluding her remarks earlier Thursday.\n\n\n\nSotomayor argued before committee members Tuesday that her ruling in the Ricci case was decided on the basis of \"a very thorough, 78-page decision by the district court\" and followed an established precedent.\n\n\n\n\"This was not a quota case or (an) affirmative action case,\" she said. The case was a challenge to a firefighter test that had a wide range of difference between the pass and failure rate of different groups. The city of New Haven, she noted, was at risk of being sued by employees who could show they were \"disparately impacted\" by the test.\n\n\n\nNew Haven city officials, after a number of days of hearings, decided they wouldn't certify the test but would instead attempt to develop a test of equal value in measuring a candidate's qualifications without having a disparate impact, she said.\n\n\n\nThe question before the 2nd Circuit, Sotomayor said, was whether the city's decision was based on race or its understanding of what the law required it to do. The Circuit Court ruled that it was based on the latter.\n\n\n\nBased on established legal precedent, the 2nd Circuit decided that the city's decision was proper under established law. The Supreme Court, however, applied a new standard, she said, based on a different area of law. If she were ruling on that case today, she said, she would be bound by the new standards set by the Supreme Court.\n\n\n\nRicci was one of several witnesses who testified both for and against Sotomayor.\n\n\n\nLinda Chavez, head of the conservative Center for Equal Opportunity, which opposes affirmative action, argued that \"it is clear\" from Sotomayor's record \"that she has drunk deep from the well of identity politics.\" It is impossible for Sotomayor to be a fair judge when she has \"shown a willingness to let her policy preferences guide her,\" Chavez said.\n\n\n\nArkansas Attorney General Dustin McDaniel testified on Sotomayor's behalf, arguing that her opinion in the Ricci case was, in fact, an example of judicial restraint. It followed a string of legal precedents dating back almost three decades, he said.\n\n\n\nNew York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg also testified in favor of Sotomayor, telling committee members that she is an \"independent jurist\" with a \"sharp and agile mind\" who would bring \"a wealth of unique experience\" to the high court."}

Beset by delays of all kinds, the expedition was finally ready to sail from Halifax, Nova Scotia in early August.

{"question": "What role did Luther play in other areas' churches?", "answers": ["adviser", "adviser", "adviser"], "context": "To avoid confusing or upsetting the people, Luther avoided extreme change. He also did not wish to replace one controlling system with another. He concentrated on the church in the Electorate of Saxony, acting only as an adviser to churches in new territories, many of which followed his Saxon model. He worked closely with the new elector, John the Steadfast, to whom he turned for secular leadership and funds on behalf of a church largely shorn of its assets and income after the break with Rome. For Luther's biographer Martin Brecht, this partnership \"was the beginning of a questionable and originally unintended development towards a church government under the temporal sovereign\". The elector authorised a visitation of the church, a power formerly exercised by bishops. At times, Luther's practical reforms fell short of his earlier radical pronouncements. For example, the Instructions for the Visitors of Parish Pastors in Electoral Saxony (1528), drafted by Melanchthon with Luther's approval, stressed the role of repentance in the forgiveness of sins, despite Luther's position that faith alone ensures justification. The Eisleben reformer Johannes Agricola challenged this compromise, and Luther condemned him for teaching that faith is separate from works. The Instruction is a problematic document for those seeking a consistent evolution in Luther's thought and practice."}

{"question": "What is traditionally written in a ledger?", "answers": ["account", "accounts"], "context": "Example of General Ledger - ExamplesOf.comExample of General Ledger \n Example of General Ledger \n See all Business \n Example of General Ledger \n The general ledger is the primary record of transactions for a business, and is a primary record of accounting data. The general ledger is based on a series of credits and debits, intended to produce a balance which accurately shows an equal value on both sides of the balance sheet. This is called double entry accounting, and is the traditional Western method of account record keeping. The principles related to the general ledger are also the basis of the standard accounts balance process. General ledgers are also used as primary methods in bookkeeping, usually the most reliable comprehensive method of accounting for small business. \n Examples of General Ledger: \n To illustrate the posting of transactions in the general ledger, consider the following transactions taken from the example on general journal entries: \n Date  What Is a Ledger?

It usually lists the debits and credits associated with the entity for which the transactions are being recorded. Ledgers were traditionally on paper and often entered in bound books. With the start of the computer age, electronic versions became more common. \n There are three common types of ledger: general, purchase, and sales ledgers. Often all three of these are used together. The general ledger is the most elaborate, while purchase and sales ledgers record the transactions of only creditors and customers respectively. \n The general ledger is typically organized by the five different kinds of accounts: assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and owner’s equity. Some general ledgers will also show gains and losses. It uses a style of input known as double-entry bookkeeping . This means that if something is taken away from one account then it must be added to another. The standard format is for the debit entries to appear in a column on the left side and the credits on the right. \n A purchase ledger tracks all amounts that are paid and owed to a credit supplier. This can be one book with several categories or a series of books so that there is one for each supplier. Common entries include information from invoices and credit memos. The amount owed to the supplier is the balance, also known as accounts or trade payable. \n The sales ledger tracks credit customer, or debtor, accounts. This record is frequently referred to as accounts or trade receivable. The balance of this account is the amount due from credit customers. These kinds of transactions are recorded as assets. Sales ledgers are frequently used to determine how much is owed by customers at month-end or to create sales reports. \n Ledgers typically serve as a permanent record for all financial transactions of an entity. They are often used for the generation of financial statements each reporting period. These records can also be useful for researching past issues. Having accurate ledgers is not only best for the well-being of the entity, but also a legal necessity. \n Computer ledgers come in different formats, depending on the needs of the entity. Small, simple operations can often use spreadsheets to track accounts. Larger organizations will often use accounting software. This can be a mass-market product, a customized program, or software that is developed especially for the company. \n Ad  ledger Definition in the Cambridge English Dictionaryledger Definition in the Cambridge English Dictionary \n › a book or a computer document in which a company's accounts are recorded , especially the money it has spent and received: \n The loan appears not to have been entered in the ledger.

{"question": "Which party is currently the largest among political party lines?", "answers": ["the conservative European People's Party", "European People's Party", "European People's Party", "European People's Party"], "context": "While the Commission has a monopoly on initiating legislation, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union have powers of amendment and veto during the legislative process. According to the Treaty on European Union articles 9 and 10, the EU observes \"the principle of equality of its citizens\" and is meant to be founded on \"representative democracy\". In practice, equality and democracy are deficient because the elected representatives in the Parliament cannot initiate legislation against the Commission's wishes, citizens of smallest countries have ten times the voting weight in Parliament as citizens of the largest countries, and \"qualified majorities\" or consensus of the Council are required to legislate. The justification for this \"democratic deficit\" under the Treaties is usually thought to be that completion integration of the European economy and political institutions required the technical coordination of experts, while popular understanding of the EU developed and nationalist sentiments declined post-war. Over time, this has meant the Parliament gradually assumed more voice: from being an unelected assembly, to its first direct elections in 1979, to having increasingly more rights in the legislative process. Citizens' rights are therefore limited compared to the democratic polities within all European member states: under TEU article 11 citizens and associations have the rights such as publicising their views and submit an initiative that must be considered by the Commission with one million signatures. TFEU article 227 contains a further right for citizens to petition the Parliament on issues which affect them. Parliament elections, take place every five years, and votes for Members of the European Parliament in member states must be organised by proportional representation or a single transferable vote. There are 750 MEPs and their numbers are \"degressively proportional\" according to member state size. This means - although the Council is meant to be the body representing member states - in the Parliament citizens of smaller member states have more voice than citizens in larger member states. MEPs divide, as they do in national Parliaments, along political party lines: the conservative European People's Party is currently the largest, and the Party of European Socialists leads the opposition. Parties do not receive public funds from the EU, as the Court of Justice held in Parti écologiste \"Les Verts\" v Parliament that this was entirely an issue to be regulated by the member states. The Parliament's powers include calling inquiries into maladministration or appoint an Ombudsman pending any court proceedings. It can require the Commission respond to questions and by a two-thirds majority can censure the whole Commission (as happened to the Santer Commission in 1999). In some cases, the Parliament has explicit consultation rights, which the Commission must genuinely follow. However its role participation in the legislative process still remains limited because no member can actually or pass legislation without the Commission and Council, meaning power (\"kratia\") is not in the hands of directly elected representatives of the people (\"demos\"): in the EU it is not yet true that \"the administration is in the hands of the many and not of the few.\""}

{"question": "Under what law is value of a worker determined?", "answers": ["supply and demand", "law of supply and demand", "supply and demand"], "context": "In a purely capitalist mode of production (i.e. where professional and labor organizations cannot limit the number of workers) the workers wages will not be controlled by these organizations, or by the employer, but rather by the market. Wages work in the same way as prices for any other good. Thus, wages can be considered as a function of market price of skill. And therefore, inequality is driven by this price. Under the law of supply and demand, the price of skill is determined by a race between the demand for the skilled worker and the supply of the skilled worker. \"On the other hand, markets can also concentrate wealth, pass environmental costs on to society, and abuse workers and consumers.\" \"Markets, by themselves, even when they are stable, often lead to high levels of inequality, outcomes that are widely viewed as unfair.\" Employers who offer a below market wage will find that their business is chronically understaffed. Their competitors will take advantage of the situation by offering a higher wage the best of their labor. For a businessman who has the profit motive as the prime interest, it is a losing proposition to offer below or above market wages to workers."}

{"question": "what men have skeletal dysplasia", "answers": ["Bill Klein,"], "context": "(PEOPLE.com) -- Pregnancy joy turned to sadness for the stars of TLC's \"The Little Couple,\" as they learned on Tuesday's episode of the successful transfer of an embryo to their surrogate, who later miscarried their unborn child.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Jennifer Arnold and husband Bill Klein, who both have skeletal dysplasia, a bone-growth disorder that causes dwarfism, have documented their road to parenthood on the show. They decided to use a surrogate to have a baby, because of the challenges a pregnancy could pose to her health.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the season finale, Arnold and Klein learned their surrogate was expecting. \"After we got pregnant, the craziness ensued with us wondering what to do with the baby's room, making sure our surrogate was getting her daily dose of baby vitamins,\" Klein tells PEOPLE.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut since filming their happy visit to the doctor, the couple's surrogate lost the pregnancy. Klein had to contact his wife, a neonatologist at Texas Children's Hospital, while she was at work in order to tell her the heartbreaking news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I didn't want her to be the last person to find out,\" he says. \"Ugly or happy, it needs to be told. It was a very tough day, and Jen took it harder than she originally expected.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I cried my eyes out,\" Arnold tells PEOPLE. \"I deal with families who lose their babies and I will cry with them, but I thought I would be stronger. Nothing can completely prepare for all that when it is about you.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the couple were able to get together at the end of the day, they mourned, crying and comforting one another and later talking to family and friends. The next day they decided they would continue trying to start a family, with both surrogacy and adoption as possible paths.\n\n\n\n\n\nKim Kardashian's Marriage: Mistake or Fake?\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Bill was a rock, and he held me through everything,\" Arnold says. \"By the next morning, I realized that I needed to try again. We were so close and so pregnant with the ultrasound looking good, and so it was horrible for it to end. But I couldn't have said I was done. A lot of family asked, 'Do you want to go through this again?' And my answer is, yes. I would be miserable if I didn't try again.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA Rocky Road\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause both Klein and Arnold carry a single gene for their type of skeletal dysplasia, there is a chance they could both pass the gene on to their child, which could be lethal for their baby. To avoid this, embryos are genetically tested before implantation.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf no skeletal dysplasia genes are passed on, the baby would be healthy and average sized; if one gene is passed, the baby would be a healthy little person.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, Jen is on medication to stimulate her ovaries, which produced only half as many eggs as expected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We appreciated all the prayers and positive thinking,\" says Arnold of sharing her difficult story with the world. \"That is comforting and is giving us strength. When we lost the pregnancy, we wondered how we were going to handle it. But by sharing our story, whether it be positive or negative, I think it can help others going through similar things.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nUltimately, becoming parents is what means the most. \"We are so in love with each other and supportive of each other that we are going to be okay,\" she says. \"We really want to be parents, and that is the goal here through surrogacy and adoption. We are not done trying yet.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nKris Jenner: 'People Have to Stop Judging' Kim for Ending Her Marriage\n\n\n\n\n\nUntil that day comes, Klein cherishes life with his wife. \"I could go the next 50 or 100 years with just the two of us, because we have a great relationship,\" he says. \"Few people are so lucky to have that from the moment you meet that one person, and everything we add"}

{"question": "Who wrote the autobiography 'Rum, Bum and Concertina' published in 1977?", "answers": ["melly", "george melly"], "context": "George Melly | Music | The GuardianGeorge Melly | Music | The Guardian \n George Melly \n George Melly: singer, writer, fisherman, 'tart'. \n Julian Mitchell \n Share on Messenger \n Close \n George Melly, who has died aged 80, was one of the most genial and genuinely popular figures in the world of British entertainment. Dressed like a 30s gangster or a 40s Harlem hipster, a huge hat on his large head, his ample figure and rubbery face, with its mischievous hint of Mr Toad, were warmly welcomed wherever he went. He was a \"personality\" who actually had personality, a jazz singer who was also a cultural commentator, a devotee of the Surrealists who wrote the story-lines of a cartoon-strip. Presenter-performer, autobiographer, libertarian and in his own word \"tart\", he was \"Good-Time George\". \n Alan George Heywood Melly was born in Liverpool. His father, an easy-going man, came from a large and well-known Liverpool business family, and made a comfortable living in the wool trade, which he hated. Tom didn't mind what anyone did, so long as it made them happy. Maud, George's Jewish mother, had once dreamed of a career on the stage, and remained a leading figure in Liverpool's amateur dramatics. (George's sister Andree was to become a well-known actress.) Maud was the friend of many theatrical queens, and visiting stars such as Robert Helpman, Frederick Ashton and Douglas Byng were often at the house near Aigburth Road, as was David Webster, then running a department store in Liverpool before taking over the Royal Opera House. \n George wrote his autobiography backwards, starting with his early years in the jazz world, and working back to his childhood. Scouse Mouse (1984) is an affectionate account of 1930s middle-class Liverpool and its numerous Melly eccentrics. The snake in the Eden of Sefton Park was George's headmaster at Parkfield prep school, the alcoholic WW Twyne. A manic wielder of the house slipper, given to purple rages, Twyne deplored almost everything about the modern world except games. His denunciations of ballet and leftwing politics were so extreme that George knew at once that he would like both. Thus his interest in both anarchism and surrealism, developed at Stowe, can be traced to his comfortable Liverpudlian beginnings, just as his passion for fishing went back to family holidays in North Wales. \n George clearly lacked officer-like qualities and was unable to qualify even as a naval clerk when he was called up in 1944. He remained a skiving Ordinary Seaman for most of his three and a half years service, leaving anarchist tracts on the messdeck to annoy his superior officers. He spent most of his leaves in London getting to know the Surrealist circle that gathered round the Belgian poet and gallery-owner ELT Mesens, and relishing an exuberant homosexual life made much easier by his uniform. Rum, Bum and Concertina (1977), his account of this period, is extremely funny. As a convinced surrealist George felt an obligation to be shocking and subversive, but his sense of reality and his sense of humour kept him out of serious trouble. \n After the Navy he went to work for Mesens in his West End gallery, but was dismayed to find him a painfully bourgeois businessman, as he wrote in Don't Tell Sybil (1997), his memoir of their relationship. \n Until then George had known jazz only from records, but he now started going to live performances of what was then called \"revivalist\" jazz. These were the years of early Humphrey Lyttelton, Graeme Bell and Cy Laurie. Quite soon George was singing with Mick Mulligan's band. \n Owning Up (1965) is George's first-hand account of the professional jazz world of the 1950s, when the drinking was hard, the travel incessant and the sex easy. Under Mulligan's influence, George developed a voluminous appetite for girls, and eventually got married in 1955 to Victoria Vaughan. Never wishing to be an original singer - the whole aim of his performance was to imitate as far as"}

How so?\" \n James Bond: \"I thought Christmas only comes once a year.\" \n ―James Bond and Christmas Jones. [src] \n Dr. Christmas Jones is a fictional nuclear physicist who appeared in the 1999 James Bond film The World is Not Enough . She was played by American actress and a former fashion model Denise Richards . \n Contents \n Film biography \n Kazakhstan \n Mid-way though the film, Bond arrives at a Russian ICBM base in Kazakhstan , working undercover to investigate the terrorist Renard 's presence at the facility. Posing as a Russian nuclear scientist, Bond is introduced to Dr. Christmas Jones, an American nuclear physicist working in Russia to dismantle nuclear warheads, reducing the Russian inventory in line with treaty obligations. On their initial encounter Jones treats Bond with a combination of mistrust and mild contempt, pre-empting a discussion of her unusual forename with a warning not to bother with any Christmas jokes - she has apparently heard them all. \n After gaining access to the silo, Bond notices Renard removing a GPS locator card and a half quantity of weapons-grade plutonium from one of the nuclear devices. Before Bond can kill him, Christmas blows his cover by pointing to an inconsistency between Bond's appearance and his age as stated on his stolen ID card. Renard steals the bomb and flees, leaving everyone to die in the booby-trapped missile silo. Bond and Christmas narrowly escape the exploding silo with the weapon's locator card. \n Azerbaijan \n Christmas and 007 attempt to disarm a bomb. \n In Azerbaijan, Bond discovers that the stolen bomb has been placed in the King oil pipeline attached to an inspection rig and is heading rapidly toward the oil terminal. Bond and Christmas enter the pipeline to deactivate the bomb, and Christmas discovers that half of the plutonium is missing. They both jump clear of the rig and a large section of the pipe is destroyed by the remaining explosive charge. Bond and Jones are presumed killed and the villainess, Elektra King , decides to take advantage of the opportunity and abduct M . \n Meeting up with Bond's ex-KGB ally, Valentin Zukovsky , the group goes to Istanbul, where they realize that Renard is planning to insert the stolen plutonium into a submarine's nuclear reactor (the submarine would subsequently be hijacked by Elektra and was captained by Zukovsky's brother). The resulting nuclear explosion would destroy Istanbul, sabotaging the Russians' oil pipeline in the Bosphorus. Elektra's pipeline is planned to go around Istanbul, dramatically increasing the value of her own oil. \n Conclusion \n The pair celebrate the New Year. \n After a further assassination attempt by Elektra's hired thugs, Bond and Christmas are captured. Christmas is taken aboard the submarine, which was seized by Renard's men. Bond is taken to the tower, where Elektra tortures him with a garrotte. Bond escapes with the help of Zukovsky, frees M and kills Elektra. He then dives after the submerging submarine, boards it and frees Christmas. Following a fight, the submarine starts to dive, and hits the bottom of the Bosphorus, causing its hull to rupture. Bond catches up with Renard and fights and kills him. Bond and Christmas escape the submarine, leaving the flooded reactor to detonate safely underwater. They are subsequently shown celebrating Christmas in Turkey, culminating in a romantic liaison that is unintentionally spied on by MI6 using a new body sensor designed by R , who soon turns it off, lying to M by saying it is an error likely caused by a premature form of the \" Millennium Bug \" said to occur in 2000. \n Behind the scenes \n At the time of The World Is Not Enough's worldwide premiere on November 8th 1999 [1] , MGM signed a marketing partnership with MTV, primarily for American youths, who were assumed to have considered Bond as \"an old-fashioned secret service agent\". As a result, MTV broadcast more than 100 hours of Bond-related programmes immediately after the film was"}

The Dutch Republic rapidly became a destination for Huguenot exiles. Early ties were already visible in the \"Apologie\" of William the Silent, condemning the Spanish Inquisition, which was written by his court minister, the Huguenot Pierre L'Oyseleur, lord of Villiers. Louise de Coligny, daughter of the murdered Huguenot leader Gaspard de Coligny, married William the Silent, leader of the Dutch (Calvinist) revolt against Spanish (Catholic) rule. As both spoke French in daily life, their court church in the Prinsenhof in Delft held services in French. The practice has continued to the present day. The Prinsenhof is one of the 14 active Walloon churches of the Dutch Reformed Church. The ties between Huguenots and the Dutch Republic's military and political leadership, the House of Orange-Nassau, which existed since the early days of the Dutch Revolt, helped support the many early settlements of Huguenots in the Dutch Republic's colonies. They settled at the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa and New Netherland in North America."}

It is, according to Peter Viney, a historian of the group, \"the Big Pink track that has appeared on most subsequent live albums and compilations\", second only to \"The Weight\". \n  The Weight  \"The Weight\" is a song originally by the Canadian-American group The Band that was released as Capitol Records single 2269 in 1968 and on the group's debut album \"Music from Big Pink\".  Written by Band member Robbie Robertson, the song is about a visitor's experiences in a town mentioned in the lyric's first line as Nazareth.  \"The Weight\" has significantly influenced American popular music, having been listed as #41 on \"Rolling Stone\"'s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time published in 2004.  Pitchfork Media named it the 13th best song of the Sixties, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame named it one of the 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.  PBS, which broadcast performances of the song in \"Ramble at the Ryman\" (2011), \"Austin City Limits\" (2012), and \"Quick Hits\" (2012), describes it as \"a masterpiece of Biblical allusions, enigmatic lines and iconic characters\" and notes its enduring popularity as \"an essential part of the American songbook.\""}
{"question": "Which reason is given sometimes to plead not guilty involving these matters?", "answers": ["Guilt implies wrong-doing", "Guilt implies wrong-doing", "guilty of doing no wrong", "Guilt implies wrong-doing", "I may have violated some specific laws, but I am guilty of doing no wrong", "I may have violated some specific laws, but I am guilty of doing no wrong"], "context": "An important decision for civil disobedients is whether or not to plead guilty. There is much debate on this point, as some believe that it is a civil disobedient's duty to submit to the punishment prescribed by law, while others believe that defending oneself in court will increase the possibility of changing the unjust law. It has also been argued that either choice is compatible with the spirit of civil disobedience. ACT-UP's Civil Disobedience Training handbook states that a civil disobedient who pleads guilty is essentially stating, \"Yes, I committed the act of which you accuse me. I don't deny it; in fact, I am proud of it. I feel I did the right thing by violating this particular law; I am guilty as charged,\" but that pleading not guilty sends a message of, \"Guilt implies wrong-doing. I feel I have done no wrong. I may have violated some specific laws, but I am guilty of doing no wrong. I therefore plead not guilty.\" A plea of no contest is sometimes regarded as a compromise between the two. One defendant accused of illegally protesting nuclear power, when asked to enter his plea, stated, \"I plead for the beauty that surrounds us\"; this is known as a \"creative plea,\" and will usually be interpreted as a plea of not guilty."}

{"question": "What is an important personal decision for civil disobedients?", "answers": ["whether or not to plead guilty", "whether or not to plead guilty", "whether or not to plead guilty", "whether or not to plead guilty", "whether or not to plead guilty.", "whether or not to plead guilty."], "context": "An important decision for civil disobedients is whether or not to plead guilty. There is much debate on this point, as some believe that it is a civil disobedient's duty to submit to the punishment prescribed by law, while others believe that defending oneself in court will increase the possibility of changing the unjust law. It has also been argued that either choice is compatible with the spirit of civil disobedience. ACT-UP's Civil Disobedience Training handbook states that a civil disobedient who pleads guilty is essentially stating, \"Yes, I committed the act of which you accuse me. I don't deny it; in fact, I am proud of it. I feel I did the right thing by violating this particular law; I am guilty as charged,\" but that pleading not guilty sends a message of, \"Guilt implies wrong-doing. I feel I have done no wrong. I may have violated some specific laws, but I am guilty of doing no wrong. I therefore plead not guilty.\" A plea of no contest is sometimes regarded as a compromise between the two. One defendant accused of illegally protesting nuclear power, when asked to enter his plea, stated, \"I plead for the beauty that surrounds us\"; this is known as a \"creative plea,\" and will usually be interpreted as a plea of not guilty."}

{"question": "Where is the rivers' source located?", "answers": ["Turkey,"], "context": "ISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN) -- Turkish, Iraqi and Syrian ministers met in Ankara on Thursday to discuss water shortages in the major Tigris and Euphrates rivers, which run through all three countries.\n\n\n\n\n\nIraqi fishermen ride their motor boat in the waters of the Tigris River in Baghdad.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe meeting comes amid a diplomatic spat over Iraqi accusations that Syria is harboring terrorists.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Tigris River has plunged to record low levels, Iraqi farmers told CNN. Iraq is suffering a drought that its officials are calling a \"catastrophe.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBaghdad and Damascus want Turkey, where the source of the Tigris and Euphrates is located, to increase the flow of water passing through its network of dams.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Syria and Iraq are badly in need of water but our Iraqi brothers feel the need much more ... it is why this meeting is so important,\" Turkey's official Anatolian Agency quoted Syrian Irrigation Minister Nader al-Bounni as saying at the start of Thursday's tri-partite meeting to address water resources. \"Our dams are empty and we have human needs.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso attending the meeting was Iraq's Water and Natural Resources and Turkey's Environment and Forestry minister, as well as its Energy minister .\n\n\n\n\n\nBut at the start of the meeting at a hotel in the Turkish capital, Turkey's energy minister seemed to rule out delivering significant quantities of additional water to Iraq and Syria.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are aware of the water needs of Syria and Iraq,\" Energy Minister Taner Yildiz told journalists at the entrance to the conference. \"Water is not plenty in Turkey, and therefore we cannot exceed the determined amount too much.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTurkey provided Syria and Iraq 500 cubic meters of water a second, Yildiz said. But, he added, central and eastern Turkey had only received 350 cubic meters/second of water this year.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Turkish government said rainfall over its part of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers plummeted by about 46 percent in the past three years.\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the past decade, some environmental and political analysts have written about the scenario of a \"water war\" possibly breaking out in the Middle East as countries affected by climate change compete over dwindling access to fresh water.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, there are more immediate political tensions complicating relations between the neighboring countries.\n\n\n\n\n\nSyria and Iraq have withdrawn their ambassadors from each others' capitals after a series of deadly suicide truck bombings in Baghdad killed more than 100 people last month.\n\n\n\n\n\nIraq demanded Syria hand over several suspects it accuses of organizing the attacks. Damascus has denied charges that it is harboring insurgents.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis week, Turkey's foreign minister shuttled between Baghdad and Damascus, carrying messages between the two capitals in an effort to defuse tensions."}

This started out as a competition between rival lighting systems with Edison holding all the patents for DC and the incandescent light and Westinghouse using his own patented AC system to power arc lights as well as incandescent lamps of a slightly different design to get around the Edison patent. The acquisition of a feasible AC motor gave Westinghouse a key patent in building a completely integrated AC system, but the financial strain of buying up patents and hiring the engineers needed to build it meant development of Tesla's motor had to be put on hold for a while. The competition resulted in Edison Machine Works pursuing AC development in 1890 and by 1892 Thomas Edison was no longer in control of his own company, which was consolidated into the conglomerate General Electric and converting to an AC delivery system at that point."}

{"question": "A swanee whistle was used to provide the voices of whom, in an animated tv series?", "answers": ["clangers"], "context": "Slide whistleA slide whistle  (variously known as a swanee or swannee whistle, lotos flute  piston flute,  or jazz flute) is a wind instrument consisting of a fipple like a recorder's and a tube with a piston in it. Thus it has an air reed like some woodwinds, but varies the pitch with a slide. The construction is rather like a bicycle pump. Because the air column is cylindrical and open at one end and closed at the other, it overblows the third harmonic. \n Piston flutes, in folk versions usually made of cane or bamboo, existed in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific as well as Europe before the modern, manufactured version was invented, apparently in England in the nineteenth century. The latter, which may be more precisely referred to as the slide or Swanee whistle, is commonly made of plastic or metal.  \n The modern slide whistle is perhaps most familiar in its use as a sound effect (as in the sound tracks of animated cartoons, when a glissando can suggest something rapidly ascending or falling, or when a player hits a \"Bankrupt\" on Wheel of Fortune), but it is also possible to play melodies on the slide whistle. \n The swanee whistle dates back at least to the 1840s, when it was manufactured by the Distin family and featured in their concerts in England. Early slide whistles were also made by the English J Stevens & Son and H A Ward. By the 1920s the slide whistle was common in the USA, and was occasionally used in popular music and jazz as a special effect. For example it was used on Paul Whiteman's early hit recording of Whispering (1920).  Even Louis Armstrong switched over from his more usual cornet to the slide whistle for a chorus on a couple of recordings with King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band.  At that time, slide saxophones, with reeds rather than a fipple, were also built. The whistle was also widely used in Jug band music of the 1920s such as Whistler's Jug Band. \n In the 1930s through the 1950s it was played with great dexterity by Paul 'Hezzie' Trietsch, one of the founding members of the Hoosier Hot Shots. They made many recordings. \n A more recent appearance of the slide whistle can be heard in the 1979 song \"Get Up\" by Vernon Burch. The slide whistle segment of this song was later sampled by Deee-Lite in their 1990 hit \"Groove Is in the Heart\". The Las Vegas based band Holes and Hearts also used the slide whistle on their song \"Dancing Monkey\". \n Fred Schneider of The B-52s plays a plastic toy slide whistle in live performances of the song \"Party Out of Bounds\" as a prop for the song's drunken partygoer theme, in place of the trumpet thus used in the studio for the Wild Planet song. \n In 2011 the slide whistle has enjoyed somewhat of a revival, with top session players such as Seadna McPhail guesting on a host of top selling pop albums. \n The slide whistle is probably thought of today primarily as a kind of \"toy\" instrument, especially in the West, although it has been and continues to be used in various forms of \"serious\" music.  Its first appearance in notated European classical music may have been when Maurice Ravel called for one in his opera, L'enfant et les sortilèges. More modern uses in classical music include Paul Hindemith's Kammermusik No. 1, op. 24 no. 1 (1922), Luciano Berio's Passaggio, which uses five, and the Violin Concerto of György Ligeti, as well as pieces by Cornelius Cardew, Alberto Ginastera, Hans Werner Henze, Peter Maxwell Davies, and Krzysztof Penderecki. The slide whistle is also used in many of the works of P. D. Q. Bach. \n To fans of 1970s BBC children's television, the instrument will always be associated with the voices of the Clangers. The instrument also features prominently in the game of \"Swanee-Kazoo\" in the long-running radio panel game, I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue. \n In the earliest episodes of The Simpsons, the character"}
{"question": "What period did plates reverse directions to compress the Tethys floor?", "answers": ["Jurassic Period", "Jurassic Period", "Jurassic Period"], "context": "In southern Europe, the stage was set in the Triassic Period of the Mesozoic Era, with the opening of the Tethys Ocean, between the Eurasian and African tectonic plates, between about 240 MBP and 220 MBP (million years before present). The present Mediterranean Sea descends from this somewhat larger Tethys sea. At about 180 MBP, in the Jurassic Period, the two plates reversed direction and began to compress the Tethys floor, causing it to be subducted under Eurasia and pushing up the edge of the latter plate in the Alpine Orogeny of the Oligocene and Miocene Periods. Several microplates were caught in the squeeze and rotated or were pushed laterally, generating the individual features of Mediterranean geography: Iberia pushed up the Pyrenees; Italy, the Alps, and Anatolia, moving west, the mountains of Greece and the islands. The compression and orogeny continue today, as shown by the ongoing raising of the mountains a small amount each year and the active volcanoes."}

Rubisco has a problem—it has trouble distinguishing between carbon dioxide and oxygen, so at high oxygen concentrations, rubisco starts accidentally adding oxygen to sugar precursors. This has the end result of ATP energy being wasted and CO2 being released, all with no sugar being produced. This is a big problem, since O2 is produced by the initial light reactions of photosynthesis, causing issues down the line in the Calvin cycle which uses rubisco."}

There are too many issues like the economy, job creation and energy for these regrettable comments to distract us from the work that must be done on behalf of the American people.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats also rejected the calls for Reid's dismissal. Gov. Tim Kaine of Virginia, chairman of the Democratic Party, said \"the case is closed\" following Reid's round of apologies.\n\n\n\n\n\nDouglas Wilder of Virginia, who 20 years ago became the nation's first elected African-American governor, also rejected calls for Reid's ouster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think that what Reid was giving was a personal opinion, which wasn't affecting the laws or the operation of the dispensation of justice in our country,\" Wilder told CNN's \"State of the Union.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut he said he believes the incident \"illustrates the need for more open discussion about race.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nReid's office made clear he has no plans to step down.\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats rejected the calls for Reid's dismissal, and Reid's office made clear he has no plans to step down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Sen. Reid will stay in his position as majority leader and will run for re-election,\" his spokesman said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As the leader in the fight to pass the Voting Rights Act and legislation banning hate crimes, Sen. Reid has a long record of addressing issues that are important to the African-American community. His Republican critics who are looking to politicize the issue can't say the same.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nReid's controversial quote is in the book \"Game Change,\" due in stores Monday. The authors write that \"Reid was convinced, in fact, that Obama's race would help him more than hurt him in a bid for the Democratic nomination.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Reid said, \"I deeply regret using such a poor choice of words.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I sincerely apologize for offending any and all Americans, especially African-Americans for my improper comments. I was a proud and enthusiastic supporter of Barack Obama during the campaign and have worked as hard as I can to advance President Obama's legislative agenda,\" Reid said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his defense, he pointed to his efforts to integrate the Las Vegas strip and the gaming industry, among other legislation favored by African-American voters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I have worked hard to advance issues important to the African-American community,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd the senate leader called Obama on Saturday afternoon to apologize for the remarks. In a statement issued after the call, Obama said, \"As far as I am concerned, the book is closed.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Harry Reid called me today and apologized for an unfortunate comment reported today,\" the president said. \""}

Its most familiar effect is beta decay (of neutrons in atomic nuclei) and the associated radioactivity. The word \"weak\" derives from the fact that the field strength is some 1013 times less than that of the strong force. Still, it is stronger than gravity over short distances. A consistent electroweak theory has also been developed, which shows that electromagnetic forces and the weak force are indistinguishable at a temperatures in excess of approximately 1015 kelvins. Such temperatures have been probed in modern particle accelerators and show the conditions of the universe in the early moments of the Big Bang."}

{"question": "What did columnist describe Draper as?", "answers": ["sexy."], "context": "(The Frisky) -- There's no question that I find Don Draper sexy. If I lived in \"Mad Men\" land for a day, I would totally make out with him on his Sterling-Cooper purchased desk. In real life? Not so much. At least not anymore.\n\n\n\n\n\nDon Draper of \"Mad Men\" is a complicated man underneath a confident exterior, columnist warns.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat makes Don Draper so drool-worthy on screen does not translate in real life. Actually, certain things do translate -- tall, dark and handsome is still tall, dark, and handsome in the real world.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut that aloof, secretive, and calculating personality that seduces his onscreen paramours and the show's viewers? Not easy to live with.\n\n\n\n\n\nDon Draper is written as an extremely complicated and deeply flawed man who does some awful things, like cheating repeatedly on his wife, Betty, and using information he gleans from her therapist to manipulate her.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the reasons and motivations behind his repulsive actions are slowly being revealed with each new episode. As with any TV show or movie, we itch to know what possesses someone to do the things he does, and we expect that writers as glorious as the ones behind \"Mad Men\" will eventually lead us to deep understanding of who Don Draper is and how he will evolve into a better man.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn real life, such life-changing revelations don't always come.\n\n\n\n\n\nI dated a Don Draper-type for years. There were superficial similarities, like that they both worked in similar industries (just decades apart) and had a knack for always being \"on.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGuys like Don Draper are great at their jobs for a multitude of reasons, but one of them is that they present themselves as calm, collected, and unmoved by the opinions and emotions of others.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a business situation this comes across as professional, confident, and reassuring to the client that the task at hand will be accomplished flawlessly. In a real-life romantic relationship, the refusal or inability to \"turn it off\" can be frustrating and painful for the other person involved.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the same time, being one of the few who is able to get past the facade feels powerful. When you're in love, having that power only makes you feel even more special. The Frisky: 10 things women don't understand about men\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are reasons why Draper's wall is so high and impenetrable. Knowing those reasons -- or at least some of them -- makes viewers sympathetic to him. There's an abused boy beneath that tough exterior! A man with secrets so big, he has to hide behind a wall all of the time.\n\n\n\n\n\nBetty Draper may not know Don's secrets, but they do share a bond he doesn't have with other people. The women he cheats with? They don't know him at all and they don't have the ability or even the interest in seeing something deeper like Betty does.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey're not threatening to his persona, but she is. These are, of course, just excuses for his bad behavior that should never fly in real life.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy ex had his own reasons for presenting a facade, for not letting anyone get too close, for acting like a jerk; some he shared, some I figured out, but all made me want to stay with him. The Frisky: Could you get past hearing \"I don't love you anymore?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't know if my Draper-esque ex cheated -- though I suspect he did -- but I do think he broke up with me because I was a threat. I saw something deeper that was fragile but wonderful, and I wanted more of it. It was enough to make me overlook the shallowness of his outward persona.\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, Don Draper gives viewers plenty to love and root for, like his support of Peggy Olson, his disinterest in Pete Campbell's brown-nosing, his delivery of that Kodak pitch in the first season, and the punch he landed on Jimmy Barrett's jaw.\n\n\n\n\n\nLike Tony Soprano"}

C O M \n D A N H O L M E S . C O M \n 5 minute readby Dan Holmes \n Want to get a cheap laugh? Walk up to the bar and say “Bartender, I’ll have a Sex on the Beach, please.” Side-splitting and knee-slapping humor, indeed. \n What’s in a name? well, when it comes to our favorite drinks, a lot. Many drinks are named for the place they were invented, like the “Manhattan”, “Long Island Ice Tea”, and the “Daquiri” (Daquiri, Cuba). Some are named for their ingredients, which is pretty boring, but descriptive. Witness “7 & 7”, “Jack and Coke”, “Lemon Drop”. \n Then there are those cocktails with more interesting origins. Here are five. \n Screwdriver \n One of the most popular drinks in the world, the Screwdriver can serve as a base for many other popular drinks. The origins of the cocktail are clandestine. In the 1950s, workers on oil rigs in the Persian Gulf would work incredibly long and dangerous hours. So, of course they relieved the tedium with alcohol. Apparently, a few of them, some sources say a mix of Turks, Serbs, Albanians, American engineers, and maybe a Greek or two, poured orange juice and vodka into cans while working on the rigs. The name came from the workers using a screwdriver to stir their secret alcoholic elixir. \n Outside the US, it is often referred to as “vodka and orange”, but no matter where you order it, the two base ingredients are the same. Variations include: the “Poor Man’s Screwdriver” (substitute Sunny D for orange juice); the “Tang Banger” (use TANG); the “Brass Monkey” (a traditional Screwdriver with dark rum added); and the popular “Harvey Wallbanger” (splash some Galliano on top). \n 2 ounces vodka \n 5 ounces fresh orange juice \n Slice of orange \n Fuzzy Navel \n We have to turn our attention to an unlikely place to learn the origins of this drink. At the Wagon Tongue Bar in Omaha, Nebraska, the Fuzzy Navel was born in the 1980s. The 80’s were a time of renewed interest in highballs, cocktails, and mixed drinks. A liquor distributor named Jack Sherman came up with the concoction, made by combining peach schnapps and orange juice. “Fuzzy” refers to the peach, and “navel” to the orange. A  New York Times food and drink critic described the ensuing craze as “a kind of cult, rallying points for young drinkers in search of fun and not too picky about taste”. \n By adding vodka to the fuzzy navel you turn the Fuzzy Navel into a “Hairy Navel”, the “hair” referring to the increased strength of alcohol in the drink. \n 1 1/2 ounces peach schnapps \n orange juice to fill \n Pour the peach schnapps into a highball glass filled with ice cubes, top with orange juice, stir well. \n Tom Collins \n Talk about an interesting tale, the story of how Tom Collins came about is bizarre and traces back to a much different time in American society. \n In Pennsylvania in the 19th century, Tom Collins was the name given to a fictional bogeyman who gossiped about locals. Patrons in pubs and restaurants would sprinkle their conversation with “Have you seen Tom Collins?” And, eventually, to be “known by Tom Collins” was to imply that someone was talking about that person. Newspapers ran hoax stories claiming to be about the real Tom Collins, who invariably was in trouble of some sort. It became so popular that “Tom Collins folk songs” were written and performed on stages all over the east coast. By the mid-1870s Tom Collins had a secure place in American folk lore. \n The"}

Mullett - A Touch of Frost (UK) Characters - ShareTVSupt. Mullett - A Touch of Frost (UK) Characters - ShareTV \n Bruce Alexander is an English actor, perhaps most famous for his portrayal of Superintendent Mullet in ... \n Character Bio \n Superintendent Norman Mullet (played by Bruce Alexander), a social climber concerned with appearances and ambitious for promotion, is Frost's boss and his constant foil on the job. Mullet has a love-hate relationship with Frost whose detective skills he admires but whose people and political skills he abhors. Mullet frequently threatens to sack Frost but Frost's ability to close cases usually saves him. In addition, receiving the George Cross made Frost \"the Chief Constable's blue-eyed boy\", thus protecting Frost from being sacked or retired by Superintendent Mullet. Frost's nickname for Mullet is \"Horn-rimmed Harry\" due to the traditional design his spectacles and Frost also has a plastic, mounted \"Grey Mullet\" hanging on his office wall (a Grey Mullet is a species of fish commonly found in British coastal waters but not usually eaten as it is regarded as being bland). While, in early seasons, the relationship between Frost and Mullet largely mimicks the hostile and antagonistic one they share in the books, they are portrayed as getting on considerably better in later seasons. This coincides with Mullet himself slowly developing over time to becoming more likeable than when he first appears in the pilot episode. \n Episode Screenshots  A Touch of Frost (TV series) - crimetv.comA Touch of Frost (TV series) \n A Touch of Frost (TV series) \n A Touch of Frost (TV series) \n Genre \n based on the characters created byR.

D. Wingfield.It stars David Jason as Detective Inspector William Edward \"Jack\" Frost, known almost universally as Jack, an experienced and dedicated detective who frequently clashes with his superiors. In his cases, Frost is assisted by a variety of different detective sergeants, with each bringing a different slant to the particular case. Comic relief is provided by Frost's interactions with the bureaucratically-minded Superintendent Norman Mullett, played by Bruce Alexander.The series is set in the fictional South-Midlands town of Denton, and is marked by a gritty tone. The role of Frost was notable in changing the public perception of David Jason from a predominantly comic actor to a dramatic actor. \n Main characters \n Edit Block \n DI Jack Frost, as depicted by the comic actor David Jason, is a very empathic and sensitive detective, whose talents are offset by human failings. This is marginally different to how he is portrayed in the novels, where he often lacks empathy and has a gruff, coarse, almost offensive tone. He is frequently shown to shirk paperwork, leaving his subordinates to do the work. Frost is widowed in the first episode. He had planned to leave his wife but just as he was going to tell her she announced that she had been diagnosed with terminal cancer. After going on a drinking session, he recklessly approached an armed man, who shot him. As a result of this he was awarded the highest British civilian award for gallantry, the George Cross. He is respected and admired by his colleagues and is shown to be a good-hearted, if flawed, character. \n Superintendent Norman Mullet (played by Bruce Alexander), a social climber concerned with appearances and ambitious for promotion, is Frost's boss and his constant foil on the job. Mullet has a love-hate relationship with Frost whose detective skills he admires but whose people and political skills he abhors.

{"question": "What clears Texas Legislature?", "answers": ["that would crack down on convicts caught with phones and allow prison systems to monitor and detect cell signals."], "context": "(CNN) -- In the black market of prison life, cell phones have become perhaps the hottest commodity. Now, Texas is among a growing number of state governments going after them.\n\n\n\nHundreds of contraband cell phones were found behind bars or in transit to Texas inmates in 2008.\n\n\n\nTiny, easy to hide and an unmonitored link for convicts to the outside world, cell phones are valuable contraband, fetching a greater asking price from convicts than some shipments of illegal drugs.\n\n\n\nJohn Moriarty, inspector general for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, said that one phone can fetch as much as $2,000.\n\n\n\n\"It takes one crooked prison worker to populate a whole prison unit with them,\" he said.\n\n\n\nMore than 1,200 wireless phones sit in law enforcement evidence rooms, all found behind bars or in transit to Texas inmates in 2008.\n\n\n\nMoriarty is the investigator and bloodhound the state of Texas uses to trail the illegal traffic.\n\n\n\n\"These are not stupid people,\" he said of the coordinated efforts to slip phones into the prison and hide them. \"There are a lot of hands in between and they all want a piece of the action.\"\n\n\n\nAccomplices on the outside vary from family members, to friends to fellow criminals who buy or steal the phones and charge them with minutes.\n\n\n\nThe contraband is then moved through an elaborate series of drop points and usually ferried into the walls of a prison by a guard or trustee -- an escape engineered in reverse. Finding the dirty prison employee is often the key.\n\n\n\n\"Some of these guys make next to nothing, so you can see how easy it could be to corrupt them,\" Moriarty said.\n\n\n\nState Sen. John Whitmire, a Houston Democrat and the chair of the state senate's Criminal Justice Committee, became an ally of Moriarty's after one phone call in October.\n\n\n\nHe picked up a phone slip from his secretary and called the number on it -- only to realize he had returned a call to a death row inmate's cell phone.\n\n\n\nThe inmate, he said, was Richard Tabler -- a convicted double murderer who was sharing a wireless phone with nine other inmates.\n\n\n\n\"At first I thought it was a hoax,\" said Whitmire, who said he called the state justice board and \"read them the riot act.\"\n\n\n\nWhitmire is one of the sponsors of a bill in the Texas Legislature that would crack down on convicts caught with phones and allow prison systems to monitor and detect cell signals. It's en route to Gov. Rick Perry's desk after clearing both houses of the legislature this week.\n\n\n\nOther efforts are under way at both the state and federal level.\n\n\n\nIn January, U.S. Rep.

Other ten-letter words with this property are PEPPERROOT, PEPPERWORT, PERPETUITY, PEWTERWORT, PIROUETTER, PREREQUIRE, PRETORTURE, PROPRIETOR, REPERTOIRE, REPETITORY, TETTERWORT. If hyphens are allowed, then TEETER-TOTTER (12 letters) is possible, as is TEETER-TOTTERER (14 letters), although the latter is not found in dictionaries. Another possible 12-letter word, POWERTRIPPER, is also not in any major dictionary. \n SHAKALSHAS (10 letters) is the longest word which can be typed using only the middle row of letters on the keyboard. Others include HAGGADAHS, FLAGFALLS, HADASSAHS, GALAGALA, GALAHADS, HASKALAH, and ALFALFAS. \n The only dictionary word which can be typed using only the bottom row of letters is ZZZ (to indicate sleeping). (There are no vowels in the bottom row.) \n AFTERCATARACTS, TESSERADECADES and TETRASTEARATES (each 14 letters) are the longest words which can be typed using only the fingers of the left hand, using the standard method of typing. \n Using only the fingers of the right hand, one can type the 12-letter word JOHNNY-JUMP-UP (common name for a flower) including the hyphens, and also PHYLLOPHYLLIN (13 letters). \n Subalphabetic Words \n FICKLEHEADED and FIDDLEDEEDEE are the longest English words consisting only of letters in the first half of the alphabet, each being 12 letters long. The 13-letter CABBAGEHEADED and ILLEFFACEABLE are not in dictionaries. Unfortunately, neither is HIGGLEHAGGLED nor GIBBLEGABBLED, also 13 letters each. \n It is harder to make long words from the second half of the alphabet, as there are only two vowels, and these vowels are less common than those found in the first half of the alphabet. The longest is NONSUPPORTS (11 letters), although if place names are allowed then the 13-letter words TUTTOQQORTOOQ (in Greenland) and ROSSOUWSPOORT (in South Africa) are valid. \n ACCEDED, CABBAGE, BAGGAGE, DEFACED, EFFACED, and FEEDBAG are seven-letter words which can be played on a musical instrument, that is to say they contain only letters in the range A-G. CABBAGED, at eight letters, is the longest such word. \n Symmetrical Words \n Closely related to palindromes , symmetrical words are words that have an axis of symmetry, or point of rotational symmetry. Needless to say, it is relevant whether the word is written in upper or lower case. \n Some long words with horizontal symmetry are: BEDECKED, BOOHOOED, CHECKBOOK, CODEBOOK, COOKBOOK, DECIDED, DIOXIDE, DOBCHICK, EXCEEDED, HOODOOED, and KEBOBBED.

Consequently, the number of boats landing in Aden has jumped from 60 to 361 since January while the number of fatalities has remained constant, according to UNHCR.\n\n\n\nThe agency attributed the surge to strife in Somalia, where riots continued in the capital city of Mogadishu for the second day Tuesday. According to news reports, Somali soldiers killed at least two people Monday during the protests over rising food prices.  Watch protesters take to the streets »\n\n\n\nSomali refugees pay as much as $150 to cross the Gulf of Aden in search of asylum. Because of its proximity to the war-torn country, Yemen is a common destination for Somalis fleeing economic hardship, famine and war.\n\n\n\nYemen is also an attractive location because Somalis receive automatic refugee status in the fellow Muslim country. New smuggling routes across the Red Sea have also led to increased numbers of refugees in Yemen, according to the UNHCR.\n\n\n\nRefugees often die before reaching Yemen because of dangerous sea conditions and overcrowded vessels. Others die at the hands of their smugglers, who order the passengers to jump overboard when the Yemeni coast guard approaches the vessel.\n\n\n\nYemen's coast guard stepped up patrols of its coastline this year in an attempt to deter smugglers, according to the UNHCR, which operates shelters and reception centers for refugees in Yemen. The coast guard has also seized boats and given them Somali fishermen affected by the 2004 tsunami."}

Keep checking Rotten Tomatoes for updates! \n Audience Reviews for The Sculptress \n The Sculptress (1997) PBS Mystery! Olive Martin (Quirke), a heavily overweight young woman is convicted of killing  butchering her mother  sister  sentenced to life imprisonment. However, when she is assigned to write a book about her life, author Rosalind Leigh (Goodall) begins to develop a relationship with Olive  is soon convinced of her innocence. With the help of restaurant owner  former policeman Hal Hawksley (Fulford), she sets out to prove it  undo what she sees as a miscarriage of justice. However, all is not what is seems.. 'The nature of the crime -- she carved her mother  young sister into parts with an ax , hence 'sculptress' -- the grossness of her person (26 stone of lard  jelly)  the grim refusal to plead diminished responsibility all ensure the murderess a special place in the chamber of horrors. Rosalind Leigh (Goodall) is a 'natural' for the woman with writer's block  personal problems who tries to get through to her in prison  finds her preconceptions gradually undermined as she investigates the background: negligent solicitor, baffled defense council, prissy father, lecherous 'uncles'  the slimy underside of provincial sociology.

The Sculptress excellent entertainment I just view this again 02/25/10--first time around I was cleaning  cooking or something. This time the 2 episodes got my undivided attention. This film is really dynamite entertainment.  five stars \n ld pierce \n ½ \n Based on Minette Walters' novel, The Sculptress is a no-frills PBS/BBC-ish production with good casting and great scripting.  Pauline Quirke (who had to wear an enormous 'fat-suit' to play the role of Olive Martin) is exquisite as the incarcerated murderess. \n Randy Tippy \n Super Reviewer \n The Sculptress is a terrific adaptation of the book, by Minette Walters, of the same name. Olive Martin (Pauline Quirke) has been convicted of a horrific crime, killing and dismembering her mother and younger sister. Roz Leigh (Caroline Goodall) has been asked by her publisher to write a book about the crime. Serious doubts as to Olive's guilt begin to arise as Roz digs deeper. Did she, or did she not commit this crime? As in Minette Walters' books, the characters have many layers that are only slowly revealed. The protagonists are flawed, some of them seriously, but that only makes them human. The book leaves things much more ambiguous than this interpretation, but this viewer is willing to overlook that because of the brilliant production. The cast is superb, the scenery benefits from some great location shooting, and the story is hypnotically compelling. \n Mark Abell \n Super Reviewer \n This film has played on Mystery PBS, Its awesome, This is one of those films where you can't judge a DVD by its cover. But anything that appears on PBS Mystery has always impressed me and this is no exception. If you like suspense this movie is full of it, worth 5 stars. \n Bruce Bruce  The SculptressThe Sculptress (1993) is a crime novel by English writer Minette Walters.

However, it was short-lived and the two parties regularly traded insults in the press with Noel Gallagher referring to Williams as \"the fat dancer from Take That\". Having won Best British Single and Best Video for \"She's the One\", Williams challenged Liam Gallagher to a televised fight, saying: \"So, anybody like to see me fight Liam? Would you pay to come and see it? Liam, a hundred grand of your money and a hundred grand of my money. We'll get in a ring and we'll have a fight and you can all watch it on TV, what d'you think about that?\". Liam Gallagher was not in the country at the time. \n Ronnie Wood and Brandon Block \n Dance DJ Brandon Block was told by his friends that he had won an award and had been summoned to the stage to collect it. Because of his advanced state of intoxication he believed them and walked on to the stage, eventually ending up next to a bemused Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood and actress Thora Birch, who were about to present the award for Best Soundtrack Album. After Block was removed from the stage by security, Wood aimed an insult in his direction, at which Block broke free to square up to the guitarist. A series of insults were then traded between the two, both of which were audible through the stage microphone, causing claims that the whole event may have been staged. Wood then threw his drink into Block's face, and the DJ was ejected from the event. Some time after the incident, Block claimed that he had subsequently apologised to Wood for his behaviour, and Wood had merely brushed it off. \n Geri Halliwell and The Spice Girls \n The Spice Girls were set to receive the Outstanding Contribution award at the 2000 Brit awards, reportedly to mark their dominance of the music scene in the past decade. There was much media speculation before and even during the event as to whether or not former Ginger Spice, Geri Halliwell would accept the award with the four remaining members of the group.  On the night, however, Halliwell declined to join her former band mates and instead ensured front page coverage the following day by performing her solo number 1 single \"Bag It Up\" straddling a pole between a pair of giant inflatable legs. Near the end of the awrads, the Spice Girls performed \"Spice Up Your Life\", an acapella version of \"Say You'll Be There\", future single \"Holler\", and \"Goodbye\". When the group accepted their award for \"Outstanding Contribution To Music\", they thanked Geri Halliwell for the award."}

The FARC statement was posted Tuesday by the New Colombia News Agency and Caracol Radio's Web site.\n\nThe statement said the guerrillas were not targeting indigenous populations but took the action \"against people who independent of their race, religion, ethnicity, social condition etc. accepted money and put themselves at the service of the army in an area that is the object of military operations.\"\n\nThe FARC communication also urged the Indians not to be manipulated by government officials who say the guerrillas are out to harm indigenous populations.\n\n\"They know of our respect for the civil community,\" the statement said, adding that a government that \"never has looked out for these indigenous communities and has plunged them into war can't be their defenders. They are their executioners!\"\n\nLast week, Colombian President Alvaro Uribe called the FARC \"executioners\" for killing Indians.\n\n\"Let the world know: The Democratic Security [forces] protect the indigenous because it is for all Colombians,\" Uribe said. \"And the FARC deceive the country, they assassinate the indigenous.\"\n\nThe governor of Narino state, Navarro Wolff, said last week the FARC had killed 10 Awa in one incident a few days earlier and 17 others the previous week.\n\nLuis Evelis Andrade of the National Indigenous Organization of Colombia, known by its Spanish acronym ONIC, said the FARC had targeted the Awa because the Indians don't want to get involved in the armed struggle and refuse to reveal information on government troop actions.\n\nSpeaking on Caracol TV, ONIC said the FARC has abducted 120 Awa since February 4 and 44 Awa have been killed this year.\n\nOthers also shared their concern.\n\n\"We are very worried about the Awa community,\" said Monsignor Gustavo Giron Higuita, the bishop of the city of Tumaco. \"It is a community that is pretty unprotected and that in the past five years has received a type of persecution by armed groups.\"\n\nThe Awa, he said, \"are pacifist, want respect of their organization and want to regain their traditions. We have been accompanying them in this process, and that's why this hurts so much.\"\n\nColombian Attorney General Alejandro Ordonez Maldonado ordered the nation's human rights commissioner to launch an investigation and take steps to help the Awa.\n\nThe Human Rights Watch organization said Wednesday that the guerrillas tortured some of the Awa before killing them with knives.\n\n\"These cruel killings violate the most basic principles of human decency and dignity,\" said Jose Miguel Vivanco, the Americas director at Human Rights Watch. \"There is no possible excuse or justification for these horrific actions.\"\n\nMonsignor Ruben Salazar Gomez, the president of the Episcopal Conference of Colombia, joined last week's chorus of criticism, calling the killings a \"very grave ... crime the whole country should condemn.\"\n\nNew York-based Human Rights Watch said in a release that group members have made numerous visits to Narino, which is one of Colombia's 32 departments, or states. Narino is in southwest Colombia, on the Pacific Ocean and the border with Ecuador.\n\nThe area has a heavy presence of various armed groups and Colombian military forces and has among the worst human rights conditions in Colombia, the human rights group said. The Awa territories have been particularly affected.\n\nThe Colombian government has issued a \"risk report\" warning that civilians in the region are in danger.\n\nThe FARC"}

Watch outrage over allegations »\n\n\n\n\"The gender verification test is an extremely complex procedure,\" said IAAF spokesman Nick Davies -- who revealed the question of Semenya's gender was first raised after her astonishing African junior championship displays.\n\n\n\n\"In the case of this athlete, following her breakthrough in the African junior championships, the rumors, the gossip were starting to build-up,\" Davies added to reporters.\n\n\n\nThere have been precedents in such cases, the most famous being that of Polish athletics great Stella Walsh, who won Olympic gold in the 100 yards at the 1932 Olympics and silver in the same event in the 1936 Olympics in Berlin.\n\n\n\nHowever, after she was shot dead during an armed robbery in 1980, the subsequent autopsy revealed she possessed male genitalia, although she also had female characteristics as well.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Yusuf Saad Kamel secured Bahrain's first-ever medal with a superb late surge to claim gold in the men's 1,500 meters.\n\n\n\nKamel, who until 2003 competed for Kenya as Gregory Konchellah and is the son of former two-time world 800m champion Billy, won in a time of three minutes 35.93 seconds.\n\n\n\nEthiopia's world indoor champion Deresse Mekonnen claimed a surprise silver with defending champion Bernard Lagat, also Kenyan-born but now competing for the United States, in bronze.\n\n\n\n\"\"It's amazing to win a world title just like my father. The only thing left for me to do is to beat his times and win more medals and get to the front of my family,\" Kamel told reporters.\n\n\n\nOlympic silver medallist Asbel Kiprop of Kenya could only finish fourth after leaving himself too much to do down the home straight.\n\n\n\nElsewhere, sprint king Usain Bolt produced an effortless run to coast into the men's 200m final and remain on course to claim a world sprint double to add to his Olympic sprint double from Beijing.\n\n\n\nThe 22-year-old Jamaican, who set a new world record of 9.58 seconds in winning the 100m on Sunday eased home to win his semifinal in 20.08 seconds and only injury looks like depriving him of gold.\n\n\n\n\"I just try and get through and make it as easy as possible,\" Bolt told reporters. \"I've been training for this for a long time now. I know what I have to do.\"\n\n\n\nThere was more sprint joy for Jamaica when Bolt's compatriot Brigitte Foster-Hylton ran a season's best time of 12.51 seconds to finally claim gold in the women's 100m hurdles.\n\n\n\nThe 34-year-old, who won world bronze in Helsinki in 2005 and silver in Paris in 2003, secured her first global title by edging out Canada's Olympic bronze medallist Priscilla Lopes-Schliep.\n\n\n\nAnother Jamaican, Delloreen Ennis-London, took the bronze medal.\n\n\n\nHowever, the biggest cheer of the night at an electric Olympic Stadium was reserved for Germany's Robert Harting, who dramatically won the men's discus gold with his sixth and final throw of 69.43 meters.\n\n\n\nPoland's long-time leader Piotr Malachowski won silver with a throw of 69.15m with defending world and Olympic champion Gerd Kanter of Estonia claiming the bronze with 66.88m.\n\n\n\nThe victory was host nations Germany's second of the championships after Steffi Nerius claimed gold in the women's javelin on Tuesday."}

{"question": "how many users has china?", "answers": ["338 million"], "context": "(CNN) -- \"China is not on the Internet, it's basically an intranet. Everything is banned by the Great Firewall,\" says Sherman So, co-author of \"Red Wired: China's Internet Revolution.\"\n\n\n\nSherman So, author of \"Red Wired,\" talks about China's online habits and Internet culture.\n\n\n\nWith 338 million Internet users in June 2009, according to the China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC), China is no longer a niche market of the online industry.\n\n\n\nChinese is the second most common language on the Internet, according to The Economist, and quickly gaining ground on English.\n\n\n\nAs the former technology writer for Hong Kong's daily English-language newspaper, South China Morning Post, So has been following closely China's exponential Internet developments over the past decade.\n\n\n\nWhat inspired her to write \"Red Wired\" was the chasm in online culture on either side of China's carefully controlled borders.\n\n\n\n\"The information gap between those who are from this part of the world and who know Chinese and those who are from another part of world and who don't is just so huge,\" observes So.\n\n\n\n\"I've talked to lots of investors, analysts, visitors to Hong Kong, and they really don't know what's happening in China. They ask the silliest questions about China and the Internet.\"\n\n\n\n\"Red Wired\" tells the stories behind China's homegrown online start-ups, often overtaking dominant start-ups that have been successful in the West but which flailed after venturing into Chinese territory.\n\n\n\nOne anecdote involves an advertisement by Baidu, China's most popular search engine, teasing Google China for not knowing Chinese.\n\n\n\nGoogle focused on high-end technology rather than Chinese linguistics. From 2002 to 2005, Google's Chinese site also suffered interference from the Chinese government, which redirected users to Baidu whenever Google's search results failed to comply with China's censorship rules.\n\n\n\nAlthough Google China has since learned the lingo and learned to cooperate with the higher order, it still trails Baidu with only 28 percent of the search-engine market share, compared to Baidu's 63 percent, according to a 2008 study by Analysys International.\n\n\n\nConquering the Internet with Chinese characteristics\n\n\n\nSo what are the unique characteristics of China's Netizens?\n\n\n\nWhile 25.5 percent of the Chinese population is now online, CNNIC's 2008 statistics sketch a relatively coherent portrait of the mainstream majority of them: 67 percent are below the age of 30; 73 percent have only a high school education or lower; 33 percent are students; and 28 percent fall into the lowest income bracket of under $75 per month.\n\n\n\nMoreover, 78 percent go online at home and 42 percent log on at an Internet cafe. Once connected, 84 percent listen to music, 75 percent instant-message, 63 percent play online games, and only 57 percent e-mail.\n\n\n\nIn short, for the vast majority of Chinese, Internet means play, not work.\n\n\n\nOne could conclude that an Internet entrepreneur's target audience in China is teenage and twenty-something students, low-end consumers in search of entertainment with plenty of time to kill.\n\n\n\nAmong the most salient of China's Internet start-ups are those that innovated on proven Western models by successfully adapting them to the Chinese market.\n\n\n\nTencent, with a 77 percent market share of instant messaging services nationwide, is one of the start-ups that gets it. Tencent is now the largest Internet company in China.\n\n\n\n\"What really made [Tencent founder] Pony Ma stand out is that he viewed his QQ instant messenger differently from other IM services such as MSN and Yahoo,\" says So.\n\n\n\n\"They viewed IM as a two-way communication, so made it as efficient as possible. They targeted the high-end white-collar users, thinking they're rich, advertisers will love them, they'll buy additional services.\n\n\n\n\"Ma thought differently. QQ was a community targeting low-end users -- kids, factory workers. They don't need efficiency, they come online to kill"}

He then made efforts during World War I to gain German military aid for the 1916 Easter Rising that sought to gain Irish independence."}

{"question": "Which clothing firm shares its name with a 1971 Academy Award winning film starring Gene Hackman?", "answers": ["french connection"], "context": "The William Friedkin Picture Pages - SuperiorPics.comThe William Friedkin Picture Pages \n The French Connection \n Background: \n Academy Award winning director, producer and screenwriter William Friedkin is best known for directing “The French Connection” (1971), from which he netted an Oscar and Golden Globe Award, and the box office hit “The Exorcist” (1973), which earned him his next Golden Globe Award and an Oscar nomination. Following a series of unsuccessful films, including “Sorcerer” (1977), “Cruising” (1980), “Rules of Engagement” (2000) and “The Hunted” (2003), he won the Cannes FIPRESCI Prize for his film “Bug” (2006). Friedkin also directed the applauded television remake of “12 Angry Men” (1997), which brought him nominations at the Emmy and DGA Awards, and several operas, including “Salome” in Munich and “Aida” in Italy. \n On August 14, 1997, Friedkin was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame thanks to his contribution to motion pictures. He is currently married to producer Sherry Lansing and was previously married to Jeanne Moreau (1977-1979), Lesley-Anne Down (1982-1985), with whom he has a son named Jack, and Kelly Lange (1987-1990). Friedkin also had a four year relationship with Jennifer Nairn-Smith, the mother of his son Cedric. \n Hurricane Billy \n Childhood and Family: \n William Friedkin was born on August 29, 1935 in Chicago, Illinois, to Louis Friedkin, a semi professional softball player turned clothing salesman, and Rachel, a nurse. He graduated from Senn High School in Chicago and grew up in poverty. He chose movies as a means to escape his rough surroundings and the Orson Welles starring movie “Citizen Kane” (1941) made a deep impact on the future director. \n William Friedkin, whose nickname is Hurricane Billy, has been married four times. He married French actress Jeanne Moreau (born January 23, 1928) on February 8, 1977, but they divorced in 1979. He was then married to British actress Lesley-Anne Down (born March 17, 1954) from 1982 to 1985. The marriage produced one son, Jack Friedkin (born 1983). William married his third wife, Kelly Lange (born December 14, 1937), on June 7, 1987. They divorced in 1990. He is now married to former actress and film studio executive Sherry Lansing (born July 31, 1944), whom he married on July 6, 1991, in Barbados. William also has a son named Cedric from a previous relationship with Australian dancer and choreographer Jennifer Nairn-Smith. \n The Exorcist \n Career: \n After graduating high school, William Friedkin began his career in the mailroom of Chicago's WGN before eventually becoming a director. In 1962, he made his directorial debut with a TV documentary called “The People vs. Paul Crump.” The film was shown at the Chicago International Film Festival in October 1965 and won the Golden Gate Award at the San Francisco Film Festival. He went on to direct the television documentaries “Time-Life Specials: The March of Time,” “The Bold Men” and “Pro Football: Mayhem on a Sunday Afternoon” (all 1965) and “The Thin Blue Line” (1966). He also directed an episode of “The Alfred Hitchcock Hour” called “Off Season” (1965). \n Two years after his move to Los Angeles, Friedkin made his feature directing debut with “Good Times” (1967), a musical comedy starring Sonny Bono and Cher. He then helmed Robert Shaw, Patrick Magee, Dandy Nichols, Sydney Tafler, Moultrie Kelsall and Helen Fraser in “The Birthday Party” (1968), Jason Robards, Britt Ekland and Norman Wisdom in the musical comedy “The Night They Raided Minsky's” (1968), which was produced by Norman Lear, and Kenneth Nelson, Leonard Frey, Cliff Gorman, and Laurence Luckinbill in the drama “The Boys in the Band” (1970), which was based on the"}

It's the fact that this president never tapped into our greatest resources: the character and resolve of the American people. He never really asked us to step up.\"\n\n\n\nJohn McCain, he said, offered only \"a plan that would explode the deficit and leave that to our kids. No real strategy to invest in our infrastructure.

That's four more years that we just can't afford.\"  Watch Warner say McCain is \"more of the same\" »\n\n\n\nBut much of his speech was devoted to the kind of bipartisan rhetoric Obama has espoused on the campaign trail.\n\n\n\n\"I know we're at the Democratic Convention, but if an idea works, it really doesn't matter whether it's got a 'D' or an 'R' next to it. Because this election isn't about liberal vs. conservative. It's not about left vs. right. It's about the future vs. the past.\n\n\n\n\"That's why we must elect Barack Obama as our next president,\" Warner said. \"Because the race for the future will be won when old partisanship gives way to new ideas.

{"question": "The use of what device represented the last major evolution of the steam engine?", "answers": ["steam turbines", "steam turbines", "steam turbines"], "context": "The final major evolution of the steam engine design was the use of steam turbines starting in the late part of the 19th century. Steam turbines are generally more efficient than reciprocating piston type steam engines (for outputs above several hundred horsepower), have fewer moving parts, and provide rotary power directly instead of through a connecting rod system or similar means. Steam turbines virtually replaced reciprocating engines in electricity generating stations early in the 20th century, where their efficiency, higher speed appropriate to generator service, and smooth rotation were advantages. Today most electric power is provided by steam turbines. In the United States 90% of the electric power is produced in this way using a variety of heat sources. Steam turbines were extensively applied for propulsion of large ships throughout most of the 20th century."}
{"question": "\"In economics, whose law states that, \"\"Bad Money Drives Out Good\"\"?\"", "answers": ["thomas gresham", "sir thomas gresham"], "context": "Gresham's lawIn economics, Gresham's law is a monetary principle stating that \"bad money drives out good\". For example, if there are two forms of commodity money in circulation, which are accepted by law as having similar face value, the more valuable commodity will disappear from circulation.    \n The law was named in 1860 by Henry Dunning Macleod, after Sir Thomas Gresham (1519–1579), who was an English financier during the Tudor dynasty. However, there are numerous predecessors. The law had been stated earlier by Nicolaus Copernicus; for this reason, it is occasionally known as the Copernicus Law.   It was also stated in the 14th century, by Nicole Oresme c.1350,  in his treatise On the Origin, Nature, Law, and Alterations of Money,   and by jurist and historian Al-Maqrizi (1364–1442) in the Mamluk Empire; and noted by Aristophanes in his play The Frogs, which dates from around the end of the 5th century BC. \n Good money and bad money \n Good money is money that shows little difference between its nominal value (the face value of the coin) and its commodity value (the value of the metal of which it is made, often precious metals, nickel, or copper). \n In the absence of legal-tender laws, metal coin money will freely exchange at somewhat above bullion market value. This may be observed in bullion coins such as the Canadian Gold Maple Leaf, the South African Krugerrand, the American Gold Eagle, or even the silver Maria Theresa thaler (Austria). Coins of this type are of a known purity and are in a convenient form to handle. People prefer trading in coins rather than in anonymous hunks of precious metal, so they attribute more value to the coins of equal weight. \n The price spread between face value and commodity value is called seigniorage.  Because some coins do not circulate, remaining in the possession of coin collectors, this can increase demand for coinage. \n On the other hand, bad money is money that has a commodity value considerably lower than its face value and is in circulation along with good money, where both forms are required to be accepted at equal value as legal tender. \n In Gresham's day, bad money included any coin that had been debased. Debasement was often done by the issuing body, where less than the officially specified amount of precious metal was contained in an issue of coinage, usually by alloying it with a base metal.  The public could also debase coins, usually by clipping or scraping off small portions of the precious metal, also known as \"stemming\" (reeded edges on coins were intended to make clipping evident). Other examples of bad money include counterfeit coins made from base metal. Today all circulating coins are made from base metals, known as fiat money. \n In the case of clipped, scraped, or counterfeit coins, the commodity value was reduced by fraud, as the face value remains at the previous higher level. On the other hand, with a coinage debased by a government issuer, the commodity value of the coinage was often reduced quite openly, while the face value of the debased coins was held at the higher level by legal tender laws. \n Examples  \n Silver coins were widely circulated in Canada (until 1968) and in the United States (until 1964 for dimes and quarters and 1970 for half-dollars) when the Coinage Act of 1965 was passed. These countries debased their coins by switching to cheaper metals thereby inflating the new debased currency in relation to the supply of the former silver coins. The silver coins disappeared from circulation as citizens retained them to capture the steady current and future intrinsic value of the metal content over the newly inflated and therefore devalued coins, using the newer coins in daily transactions. In the late 1970s, the Hunt brothers attempted to corner the worldwide silver market but failed, temporarily driving the price far above its historic levels and intensifying the extraction of silver coins from circulation. \n The same process occurs today with the copper content of coins such as the pre-1997 Canadian penny, the pre-1982 United States penny and the"}

{"question": "What dish, especially popular in parts of Wales and the English Midlands,  is traditionally made from pig's heart, liver and fatty belly meat or bacon minced together, with herbs added for flavouring and sometimes bread crumbs", "answers": ["faggots", "faggot"], "context": "Faggot (food)Faggots are a traditional dish in the UK,   especially South and Mid Wales and the Midlands of England.    It is made from meat off-cuts and offal, especially pork. A faggot is traditionally made from pig's heart, liver and fatty belly meat or bacon minced together, with herbs added for flavouring and sometimes bread crumbs. \n Faggots originated as a traditional cheap food of ordinary country people in Western England, particularly west Wiltshire and the West Midlands.  Their popularity spread from there, especially to South Wales in the mid-nineteenth century, when many agricultural workers left the land to work in the rapidly expanding industry and mines of that area. \n Faggots are also known as \"ducks\" in the Yorkshire, Lincolnshire and Lancashire, often as \"Savoury Ducks\". The first use of the term in print was in the Manchester Courier and Lancashire General Advertiser of Saturday 3 June 1843, a news report of a gluttonous man who ate twenty of them.  \n The first use in print cited in the Oxford English Dictionary is in 1851, from Henry Mayhew, where he describes a dish identical to the modern product with chopped liver and lights in an outer wrapper of caul.  This was in London. \n Preparation and serving \n Commonly, the faggot consists of minced pork liver and heart, wrapped in bacon, with onion and breadcrumbs. Often, the faggot is cooked in a crock with gravy and served with peas and mashed potato. The mixture is shaped by hand into small balls, wrapped with caul fat (the omentum membrane from the pig's abdomen), and baked. \n Another variation of faggot is Pig's fry wrapped in pig's caul: the pig's fry and boiled onions are minced (ground) together, then mixed with breadcrumbs or cold boiled potatoes, seasoned with sage, mixed herbs and pepper, all beaten together and then wrapped in small pieces of caul to form a ball. They are then baked in the oven and are usually served cold.  \n Production \n The dish gained in popularity during the rationing in World War II, though its popularity has declined in recent years. Faggots are often homemade and are to be found in traditional butchers' shops and market stalls, though larger supermarkets generally stock the Mr Brain's brand of mass-produced faggot. This is a frozen food product available in Britain, made of liver and onions rolled into meatballs and served in a sauce. These differ significantly from traditional faggots, which have a coarser texture and contain far less water. \n A popular dish is faggots and peas. This combination is common in the Black Country area of the West Midlands. It is still common to see small butchers' shops in the area selling faggots cheaply, made to their own recipe. \n Double meaning \n The use of the word \"faggot\" has caused controversy due to its additional meaning  as a pejorative term for a homosexual man in American English. In 2004, a radio commercial for the UK supermarket chain Somerfield, in which an American man rejects his wife's suggested dinner saying \"I've got nothing against faggots, I just don't fancy them\" was found to have breached the Advertising and Sponsorship Code and was banned by the industry regulator Ofcom.  In November 2013, it was reported that British Facebook users had been blocked temporarily for using the word, in its culinary sense, on the website. Facebook said that the word had been \"misinterpreted.\"  Food Dictionary : Cook AdviceFood Dictionary : Cook Advice \n Home › \n Food Dictionary \n a | b | c | d | e | f | g | h | i | j | k | l | m | n | o | p | q | r | s | t | u | v | w | x | y | z \n A la mode \n Served with or in the fashion of.

One FCC Commissioner saw the possibility of ABC, funded by UPT, becoming a viable and competitive third television network. On February 9, 1953, the FCC approved UPT's purchase of ABC in exchange for $25 million in shares. The merged company, renamed American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres, Inc. and headquartered in the Paramount Building at 1501 Broadway in Manhattan, owned six AM and several FM radio stations, five television stations and 644 cinemas in 300 U.S. cities. To comply with FCC ownership restrictions in effect at the time that barred common ownership of two television stations in the same market, UPT sold its Chicago television station, WBKB-TV, to CBS (which subsequently changed the station's call letters to WBBM-TV) for $6 million, while it kept ABC's existing Chicago station, WENR-TV. The merged company acquired the WBKB call letters for channel 7, which would eventually become WLS-TV. Goldenson began to sell some of the older theaters to help finance the new television network."}

{"question": "In the books by Raymond Briggs what type of creature is Fungus", "answers": ["bogeyman"], "context": "Saffron Tree: Some picture books by Raymond BriggsSaffron Tree: Some picture books by Raymond Briggs \n Some picture books by Raymond Briggs \n Picture book comics – who woulda  thunk it! And picture book comics about existential angst!  Laced, often enough,  with scathing social commentary, ironic asides and … horror of all horrors, sadness! Unthinkable, right? \n And yet, Raymond Briggs, one of Britain’s most celebrated authors and illustrators, does all of this and more, with incredible skill in books like Fungus the Bogeyman, The Snowman, The Bear , the Father Christmas books and Ug the Stone Age Boy. \n The Snowman, the first and most famous of Briggs’ comic picture books,  is a wordless tale about a young boy whose snowman comes magically to life one night. It lumbers into his house, explores it with childlike wonder, then takes him on a magical flight through the night sky. They return, the boy goes to sleep and wakes in the morning to find…. The book is very similar to The Bear, drawn years later.  \n The Puddleman, Briggs’ most recent work, also talks of a child encountering magic in the middle of an ordinary day. In this case, a boy out with his grandfather meets a mysterious peddler who \n leaves puddles in the middle of the road. \n later, that explores the relationship between a little girl and a polar bear that appears in her house one night. \n Misfits struggling to belong are a recurring theme in Briggs’ work. Fungus the Bogeyman, chronicles a day in the life of a bogeyman, an odious creature that is supposed to delight in scaring humans. Fungus is different, however, fretfully pondering the reason for his existence. What, he wonders as he plods through his day, is the point of the life he leads. Why, if he has everything a happy bogey needs, is he so darned blue? And why can’t anyone else in his clan understand his misery? \n Ug the Stone Age Boy, (reviewed earlier here ) struggles to rise above his circumstances. Like Fungus, he questions the way he is supposed to live his life, and attempts to invent all kinds of improvements that could revolutionize the life his tribe leads, only to be repeatedly beaten down and ridiculed. For all the humour and the sweetness of the illustrations, the books have an undercurrent of sadness running through them. \n The Father Christmas books are relatively lighter in tone, chronicling Santa’s attempts to get away from his mundane life.  Briggs’ Father Christmas is just a regular guy – he grumbles a lot,  likes a good fry up for breakfast, hangs out at home in his underclothes, reads his paper and hates the “blooming cold.” In Father Christmas Goes on Holiday, Santa exchanges his red suit for regular clothes and heads out to get some sun.   \n A lot of Briggs’ artwork is executed in colour pencil.  The soft, grainy textures of his illustrations perfectly complement the dreamlike progression of stories like The Snowman and The Bear while watercolour and inked lines perk up the art in Fungus, Ug and Father Christmas. Much like his layered artwork, his stories too feel layered and complex. \n Briggs has used a similar format – picture books designed like comics – to address more adult themes like politics and the horrors of war (The Tin-pot General and the Old Iron Woman, When the Wind Blows) and lovingly  chronicle his own parents’ lives (Ethel and Ernest). \n Posted by wordjunkie  Profile: Raymond Briggs | Books | The GuardianProfile: Raymond Briggs | Books | The Guardian \n Share on Messenger \n Close \n There is a scene in Ethel & Ernest, Raymond Briggs's 1998 strip-cartoon memoir of his parents' lives, in which we see the couple putting up the Christmas decorations.

{"question": "Rebecca Front plays Detective Chief Superintendent Innocent in which TV series?", "answers": ["lewis"], "context": "She's The Boss (From Oxford Mail)She's The Boss (From Oxford Mail) \n FAR FROM INNOCENT: Rebecca Front \n / Katherine MacAlister , covering theatre and food. Call me on 01865 425366                  / @OxMailMacky \n With the next series of Lewis about to hit our screens, Rebecca Front tells KATHERINE MACALISTER why she has so much fun playing the chief. \n Rebecca Front laughs when I ask about any romantic developments in Lewis. \n “A bit of rampant sex would be good wouldn’t it? But I can’t see it. If only so many people didn’t get murdered all the time,” she muses, before adding “but then I’d be out of a job.” \n Rebecca Front of course plays Detective Chief Superintendent Innocent, Lewis and Hathaway’s police boss in the ITV murder/mystery saga about to launch on to our screens with its fifth series. \n Worshipped in Oxford, where it is of course set and filmed, Lewis is going from strength to strength, as is Rebecca’s career. \n A regular on Lewis and In The Thick Of It, she’s also starring opposite Angelica Houston in the up-and-coming Horrid Henry film and has just filmed an episode of New Tricks. \n But Lewis is her bread and butter and pays the mortgage. \n “I’d like to do more of Lewis actually,” she says, “because I really enjoy it – the cast and production team is great and the scripts are so clever and witty. \n “Working with Kevin Whately and Lawrence Fox is great fun, but sadly I don’t get to see much of Oxford because most of my scenes are filmed inside the police station, miles away.” \n Rebecca was a student at St Hugh’s studying English and launched her career from here, so it holds many fond memories. \n “I was in the Oxford Revue and did lots of comedy, because I always wanted to be an actor. But I’d never have imagined coming back and filming here and I really enjoy it for that reason.” \n Comedy is still Rebecca’s bag, although she’s always surprised when people remark on the disparity. \n “I’m an actress and I don’t distinguish between comedy and straight roles, but I’d like to be in more straight drama actually, something really chunky that makes people cry,” she smiles. \n As for DCS Innocent, Rebecca is remarkably unprotective of her role. \n “Innocent’s job is basically to be an obstacle to Lewis and Hathaway and provide a bit of light relief so my job is to make sense of the script for her as a person.” \n What has built up is the on-screen relationship she has with Lewis and Hathaway. “To start with they were very suspicious of Innocent and to be fair, she was a pain in many ways. But now she’s more   of a colleague and has a twinkle in her eye and a sense of humour. She does still lose it from time to time and I do enjoy the scripts when she does because she’s under a lot of pressure. And Lewis   and Hathaway can be like children – enjoyable but exhausting.” \n And in real life? \n “Well, Hathaway is sombre and serious while Lawrence is mischievous, cheeky and always playing pranks, so they couldn’t be more different. Lawrence doesn’t want to be taken seriously and it’s good   to have someone like that on set because they aren’t real murders are they?” \n Lewis aside, Rebecca pads out the rest of her year with the cult series In The Thick Of It and film projects. So is this her time? “Oh no, every job is your last,” she smiles. But won’t Horrid   Henry make her a household name? “I hope I won’t get recognised more because I play Henry’s headmistress and look really weird. I’d be offended if I did actually,” she laughs. \n And yet the 46-year-old does notice a difference when Lewis is back on TV. “Well sometimes people turn and look at"}
{"question": "Where are marines being sent?", "answers": ["hostile war zones,"], "context": "Camp Lejeune, North Carolina (CNN) -- On a base accustomed to deploying Marines into some of the most hostile war zones, you would expect some hesitancy when units from here were asked to surge into some of the worst fighting since the start of the war in Afghanistan.\n\n\n\nThis week, the first of 1,500 Marines will be part of the initial wave of President Obama's surge plan to head to Afghanistan's restive provinces to support Marines and soldiers fighting a dug-in Taliban force.\n\n\n\nHowever, many Marines we talked to in this coastal, scrub pine-covered North Carolina base are more than excited to go, despite the dangers that await them.\n\n\n\n\"I'm absolutely ecstatic about the situation. I've got a good group of Marines that are behind me, so I'm real excited about the deployment,\" said Sgt. Jason Bendett of the 3rd Platoon, A Company, 2nd Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion, based at Lejeune.\n\n\n\nBut combat deaths in Afghanistan are up -- 305 this year, from 155 during 2008 -- giving pause to even the most motivated Marines.\n\n\n\n\"I think I wouldn't be human if I wasn't worried, obviously this being my first combat deployment, but the Taliban are an experienced group of fighters, and I'm not taking that for granted,\" 2nd Lt. John Auer, also of the 3rd Platoon, said during some of his final rifle range training before he deploys.\n\n\n\nMembers of this unit say they have been waiting and waiting as they watched fellow Marines deploy ahead of them this year, and they say they are more than ready to go.\n\n\n\nThey were supposed to go to Iraq in June, but as priorities shifted, they were reassigned to Afghanistan's Helmand province, where Marines are in daily battles with the Taliban.\n\n\n\n\"Having months to train and putting Marines out in the elements in Southern California, where we train, gives them a chance to see what the atmospherics are going to be like and to work as a team, so this is perfect, and we are really looking forward to this,\" Auer said.\n\n\n\n\"These guys have a lot of training under their belts, more than Marine units typically get in this situation. Senior military leaders have a lot of big expectations for this team,\" said the unit's first sergeant, Ronald Neff.\n\n\n\nLast week, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, gave some of the deploying Marines an impassioned speech about what they will face.\n\n\n\n\"We don't have a lot of time. The slope on this insurgency is going in the wrong direction, and it has picked up, three years, each year to a significant degree,\" Mullen said, describing the deteriorating security situation.\n\n\n\n\"I believe the strategy that the president laid out, the decision that he's made, is the right decision. Both those are right, and we will now move out, given our orders, and we'll carry them out. And again, I couldn't be more confident and more pleased that you are going to be at the core of that,\" he told the hundreds of Marines in attendance.\n\n\n\nMany of the Marines there are young and are facing their first combat deployment. Although all the bravado of a newly minted Marine ready for combat looks and sounds ready to fight, their eyes showed worry and concern for the unknown as they listened to Mullen.\n\n\n\n\"Best thing you can hope for is that you personally know yourself, that you're not going to freeze up,\" Lance Cpl. Matthew Jenkins said after Mullen's speech.\n\n\n\n\"We'll see how I react when it goes down in a couple weeks,\" said Lance Cpl. Joshua Williamson.\n\n\n\nQuestions remain, however, about how so many Marines without combat experience in Afghanistan can jump into a heated combat zone.\n\n\n\nMullen admitted some concerns.\n\n\n\n\"We're obviously not in an ideal situation with respect to that. I understand that, but I have a huge amount of confidence in our Marine Corps based on their ability to adapt, what they did"}

{"question": "Which of Genghis Khan's sons was disqualified from being successor because of his unstable behavior?", "answers": ["Chagatai", "Chagatai", "Chagatai"], "context": "Genghis Khan was aware of the friction between his sons (particularly between Chagatai and Jochi) and worried of possible conflict between them if he died. He therefore decided to divide his empire among his sons and make all of them Khan in their own right, while appointing one of his sons as his successor. Chagatai was considered unstable due to his temper and rash behavior, because of statements he made that he would not follow Jochi if he were to become his father's successor. Tolui, Genghis Khan's youngest son, was not to be his successor because he was the youngest and in the Mongol culture, youngest sons were not given much responsibility due to their age. If Jochi were to become successor, it was likely that Chagatai would engage in warfare with him and collapse the empire. Therefore, Genghis Khan decided to give the throne to Ögedei. Ögedei was seen by Genghis Khan as dependable in character and relatively stable and down to earth and would be a neutral candidate and might defuse the situation between his brothers."}

The inclusion of “bullfighting” probably brought to mind Hemingway’s book about the sport, Death in the Afternoon (1932). \n The automotive writer and editor Ken Purdy (1913-1972) wrote about “mountain climbing, bullfighting and automobile racing” in a 1957 issue of The Atlantic and further explained in a 1960 book: \n “I have a quotation in a story, a piece of fiction that won’t be published until next summer,” I told Portago, “something that I think you might have said: that of all sports, only bullfighting and mountain climbing and motor racing really try a man, that all the rest are mere recreations, games that children can play. Would you have said that?” \n “I couldn’t agree with you more,” Portago said. \n Purdy was discussing the quotation with driver Alfonso De Portago (1928-1957). A 1976 book called this “Marquis de Portago’s dictum,” but Portago was being told the line by Purdy. The “piece of fiction” is Purdy’s “Blood Sport,” from the July 27, 1957 Saturday Evening Post: \n “There are three sports that try a man,” she remembered Helmut Ovden saying, “bullfighting, motor racing, mountain climbing. All the rest are recreations.” \n The American writer Barnaby Conrad is sometimes creidted with the quote, but there’s no documentary evidence to support this. \n Wikipedia: Ken Purdy \n Kenneth William Purdy (April 28, 1913 – June 7, 1972) was an American automotive writer and editor. \n Purdy was born in Chicago in 1913, and raised mostly in Auburn, New York, by his mother after his father, songwriter William Thomas Purdy ( 1882–1918 ) (On, Wisconsin!) died when Ken was only six. Ken graduated in 1934 from the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Soon after, he got his first newspaper job with the Athol, Massachusetts, Daily News. From there he went to Oshkosh, Wisconsin, to the Chicago Radio Guide, to associate editor of Look; and to the United States Office of War Information as editor of Victory during World War II. He was an editor at Parade, Car and Driver, Argosy and True magazines between the late 40’s and mid 50’s. \n Purdy’s main interest just happened to be autos and the people who drove them. Among other things, he produced 35 short stories and scores of automotive pieces for Playboy. He won Playboy’s annual writers’ award three times. His Kings of the Road, published in 1949, is still a landmark. \n Purdy died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on June 7, 1972 in Wilton, CT. \n The International Motor Press Association presents the annual Ken W. Purdy Award to a writer for an outstanding body of work or a specific piece of work that deals with the automotive world. \n “There are only three sports: bullfighting, motor racing, and mountaineering; all the rest are merely games.” \n This is one in a long list of quotations mysteriously attributed to Ernest Hemingway. \n (...) \n In July of 2006, Gerald Roush, a visitor to Timeless Hemingway, provided a possible source for the “three sports” quotation. He cited a story titled “Blood Sport” by Ken Purdy, which originally appeared in the July 27, 1957 edition of the Saturday Evening Post. The story is reprinted in Ken Purdy’s Book of Automobiles (1972). Gerald provided a scan of where the quotation appeared and"}

{"question": "What can increase the tension force on a load?", "answers": ["movable pulleys", "connecting the same string multiple times to the same object through the use of a set-up that uses movable pulleys,", "every string", "connecting the same string multiple times to the same object through the use of a set-up that uses movable pulleys"], "context": "Tension forces can be modeled using ideal strings that are massless, frictionless, unbreakable, and unstretchable. They can be combined with ideal pulleys, which allow ideal strings to switch physical direction. Ideal strings transmit tension forces instantaneously in action-reaction pairs so that if two objects are connected by an ideal string, any force directed along the string by the first object is accompanied by a force directed along the string in the opposite direction by the second object. By connecting the same string multiple times to the same object through the use of a set-up that uses movable pulleys, the tension force on a load can be multiplied. For every string that acts on a load, another factor of the tension force in the string acts on the load. However, even though such machines allow for an increase in force, there is a corresponding increase in the length of string that must be displaced in order to move the load. These tandem effects result ultimately in the conservation of mechanical energy since the work done on the load is the same no matter how complicated the machine."}

{"question": "What reptile, of which there are two living species, the American and the Chinese, got its name from the Spanish for lizard?", "answers": ["alligators", "alligator"], "context": "Lizard | San Diego Zoo AnimalsLizard | San Diego Zoo Animals & Plants \n San Diego Zoo Animals & Plants \n SPECIES: More than 4,675 \n ABOUT \n What is a lizard? Lizards are part of a group of animals known as reptiles. They are most closely related to snakes. In fact, some lizards, called sheltopusiks, look like snakes because they have no legs! Many lizards today resemble the ancient reptiles of the dinosaur era. Their ancestors appeared on Earth over 200 million years ago.  \n In general, lizards have a small head, short neck, and long body and tail. Unlike snakes, most lizards have moveable eyelids. There are currently over 4,675 lizard species, including iguanas, chameleons, geckos, Gila monsters, monitors, and skinks. \n Most lizards have eyelids, just like we do, that clean and protect their eyes when they blink. But some lizards, like geckos, can’t blink! Instead, they have a clear membrane that shields their eyes from dirt or bright sun and use their tongue to clean their eyes. Many lizards, such as iguanas, can see in color. Their colorful body parts allow them to communicate with each other and help them tell which are male and which are female. \n Lizards smell stuff with their tongues! Just like snakes, a lizard sticks out its tongue to catch scent particles in the air and then pulls back its tongue and places those particles on the roof of its mouth, where there are special sensory cells. The lizard can use these scent “clues” to find food or a mate or to detect enemies. \n Lizards don’t have earflaps like mammals do. Instead, they have visible ear openings to catch sound, and their eardrums are just below the surface of their skin. Even so, lizards can’t hear as well as we do, but their hearing is better than that of snakes. \n Lizards have dry, scaly skin that does not grow with their bodies. Instead, most lizards shed, or molt, their old skin in large flakes to make way for the new skin growth underneath. The exception to this is with the alligator lizard, which may shed its skin in one piece, like a snake. The scales on lizards vary, depending on their habitat. Skinks have smooth scales so mud won’t cling to them; some lizard species have bony plates, called osteoderms, under their scales for added protection against rough terrain. \n Lizards are popular prey for many types of predators, from birds of prey to snakes and carnivorous mammals. Their camouflage and ability to stay still for hours helps keep them safe. Several types of lizards are able to escape from an enemy’s grasp by breaking off part of their own tail. The tail has a weak spot just for this purpose. If a predator grabs the lizard by its tail, the tail easily comes off. It can grow back over time, although the tail won’t look quite the same. Still, it’s better than being someone else’s dinner! \n Other lizards have different ways to stay safe. Horned lizards are able to squirt blood from tiny blood vessels in their eyes to scare away or confuse a predator. The armadillo lizard has sharp, spiky scales and can roll up into a tight ball to protect its soft belly from attack. The sungazer lizard has impressive spikes that cover its body, including the tail. The alligator lizard bites, thrashes about to get loose, or voids foul-smelling feces. The tropical girdled lizard darts into a crack, expands its body, and lodges itself in so tightly that a predator can’t remove it.  \n The shingle-backed skink is the reptile equivalent of Dr. Doolittle’s two-headed llama, the “push-me-pull-you” with its fat, wide tail that resembles the head. If confronted by a predator, the skink bends its body into a C shape, which confuses the predator because it appears as if the skink has two heads. The Australian frilled lizard has a “frill” of loose skin around its neck that can stick"}

It has been argued that, while both civil disobedience and civil rebellion are justified by appeal to constitutional defects, rebellion is much more destructive; therefore, the defects justifying rebellion must be much more serious than those justifying disobedience, and if one cannot justify civil rebellion, then one cannot justify a civil disobedients' use of force and violence and refusal to submit to arrest.

{"question": "What was Luther's major work of 60,000 words on the Jews?", "answers": ["Von den Juden und Ihren Lügen", "treatise Von den Juden und Ihren Lügen", "Von den Juden und Ihren Lügen"], "context": "Luther's other major works on the Jews were his 60,000-word treatise Von den Juden und Ihren Lügen (On the Jews and Their Lies), and Vom Schem Hamphoras und vom Geschlecht Christi (On the Holy Name and the Lineage of Christ), both published in 1543, three years before his death. Luther argued that the Jews were no longer the chosen people but \"the devil's people\", and referred to them with violent, vile language. Citing Deuteronomy 13, wherein Moses commands the killing of idolaters and the burning of their cities and property as an offering to God, Luther called for a \"scharfe Barmherzigkeit\" (\"sharp mercy\") against the Jews \"to see whether we might save at least a few from the glowing flames.\" Luther advocated setting synagogues on fire, destroying Jewish prayerbooks, forbidding rabbis from preaching, seizing Jews' property and money, and smashing up their homes, so that these \"envenomed worms\" would be forced into labour or expelled \"for all time\". In Robert Michael's view, Luther's words \"We are at fault in not slaying them\" amounted to a sanction for murder. \"God's anger with them is so intense,\" Luther concluded, \"that gentle mercy will only tend to make them worse, while sharp mercy will reform them but little. Therefore, in any case, away with them!\""}

{"question": "Who is opening up in the mall?", "answers": ["McDonald's"], "context": "(CNN) -- Shortly after McDonald's celebrated its 30-year presence in France, the fast-food chain is conquering one of the country's most valued cultural institutions --the Louvre.\n\n\n\nMcDonalds' burgers and fries will be available under the inverted glass pyramid of the Louvre.\n\n\n\nThe restaurant will be serving its fast burgers in the Carrousel du Louvre, an underground shopping mall which lies under the main entrance of the museum and which still contains an ancient wall that was discovered during construction works.  McDonald's' plans seem to have caused more media attention abroad than in France, but for some French outlets, the idea of combining fast food and ancient art is stomach churning.\n\n\n\nThe Parisian Web site \"Louvre pour tous\" (Louvre for everyone) describes McDonald's' decision to open a restaurant in the prestigious museum as \"bad taste\" and blamed the Louvre's directors for failing to prevent what could result in \"fragrances of fries drifting under Mona Lisa's nose\".\n\n\n\nA spokeswoman for the museum told CNN it was not their decision and declined to comment further on the issue.\n\n\n\nThe Carrousel du Louvre mall is managed by Unibail-Rodamco, Europe's largest property company, and not the museum itself.\n\n\n\nThe mall, which is situated next to the most visited museum in the world, counts 8.3 million visitors a year and enjoyed a total gross sales of $75 million in 2008.\n\n\n\nLe Parisien, a daily newspaper described the difference between McDonald's and the Louvre by comparing Ronald McDonald, the restaurant's clown character, to Venus de Milo, the famous ancient Greek statue of Aphrodite, which is on display at the Louvre.\n\n\n\nShould McDonald's be in the Louvre? Tell us what you think in the Soundoff box below.  Museum lovers in France are shocked about the news, but not surprised.\n\n\n\n\"Museums have to offer services like restaurants and boutiques, it's completely normal,\" Jean-Michel Raingeard, President of the Federation of French Friends of Museums told CNN.\n\n\n\nWhat worries him, however, is the choice of shops.\n\n\n\n\"Museum directors seem to care more about the number of people they attract rather than the quality of people. Should a museum be a museum or an amusement park?\" asks Jean Michel Raingeard, who is also the European vice president for The World Federation of Friends of Museums.\n\n\n\nMcDonald's sees the opening of its new restaurant next to the home of Mona Lisa as something completely normal.\n\n\n\n\"There are already many other restaurants in the mall, so we will only be one of the many restaurants that offer visitors their products.\" says a spokeswoman for McDonald's in France. \"There's even a Starbucks,\" she added.\n\n\n\nCriticism, though fierce, has not been successful: the construction work will start soon and the restaurant should be open \"by the end of the year.\"\n\n\n\nIn spite of its location, the menu will very likely stay the same. \"McDonald's functions the same way in all of France, so there will probably be no special menus,\" the spokeswoman said."}

Gaining support from princes and officers in Northern China and some other parts of the dynasty, Khanbaliq-based Tugh Temür eventually won the civil war against Ragibagh known as the War of the Two Capitals. Afterwards, Tugh Temür abdicated in favour of his brother Kusala, who was backed by Chagatai Khan Eljigidey, and announced Khanbaliq's intent to welcome him. However, Kusala suddenly died only four days after a banquet with Tugh Temür. He was supposedly killed with poison by El Temür, and Tugh Temür then remounted the throne. Tugh Temür also managed to send delegates to the western Mongol khanates such as Golden Horde and Ilkhanate to be accepted as the suzerain of Mongol world. However, he was mainly a puppet of the powerful official El Temür during his latter three-year reign.

{"question": "Whose CD does the teen use during therapy?", "answers": ["Ozzy Osbourne"], "context": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida (CNN) -- Just taking a sip of water or walking to the bathroom is excruciatingly painful for 15-year-old Michael Brewer, who was burned over 65 percent of his body after being set on fire, allegedly by a group of teenagers.\n\n\n\n\"It hurts my heart to see him in pain, but it enlightens at the same time to know my son is strong enough to make it through on a daily basis,\" his mother, Valerie Brewer, told CNN on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nBrewer and her husband, Michael Brewer, Sr., spoke to CNN's Tony Harris, a day after a 13-year-old boy who witnessed last month's attack publicly read a written statement:\n\n\n\n\"I want to express my deepest sympathy to Mikey and his family,\" Jeremy Jarvis said. \"I will pray for Mikey to grow stronger every day and for Mikey's speedy recovery.\"\n\n\n\nJarvis' older brother has been charged in the October 12 attack in Deerfield Beach, Florida.\n\n\n\nWhen asked about the teen's statement, Valerie Brewer -- who knows the Jarvis family -- said she \"can't focus on that.\"\n\n\n\n\"I would really like to stay away from that because that brings negative energy to me and I don't need that right now,\" she said.\n\n\n\nHer son remains in guarded condition at the University of Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital Burn Center. He suffered second- and third-degree burns over about two-thirds of his body, according to the hospital's associate director, Dr. Carl Schulman.\n\n\n\nThe teen faces a lifelong recovery from his injuries, Schulman told CNN's Harris.\n\n\n\n\"Michael's still got a lot of major surgery ahead of him, a lot of rehabilitation and therapy,\" Schulman said. \"He's doing about as well as could be expected at this point in his recovery, but he's got a period of probably several weeks to a couple of months still left in the hospital if everything goes well, but the recovery is lifelong. This is truly a life-changing event.\"\n\n\n\nValerie Brewer said her son's treatment is excruciating at times. Physical therapy, she said, is \"incredibly painful. He almost cries because it's so painful. He's burned badly on the backs of his knees and every time he moves his knee, it pulls, and if it's healing, it pulls the scab and it cracks, and it starts to bleed.\"\n\n\n\nThe boy must undergo hour-and-a-half showers, she said, where \"they take a piece of gauze, and they wipe off all the dead skin. They give him painkillers for that, but it's incredibly painful and it breaks my heart every time they have to do it. ... That's what we call the torture hour.\"\n\n\n\nHeavy metal musician Ozzy Osbourne sent Brewer a CD, and he plays it on a boom box during the showers, she said. \"He focuses on Ozzy, and he gets through his torture hour.\"\n\n\n\nPolice were able to interview Brewer on Monday for the first time since the incident. Hospital officials have said Brewer can communicate only in one- or two-word answers.\n\n\n\nValerie Brewer would not go into details about what her son told investigators, but said that \"he answered the questions they asked.\"\n\n\n\nThe interview was emotional for both the teen and the investigators, according to Maria Schneider, a prosecutor with the state attorney's office in Broward County.\n\n\n\n\"It was difficult for him to talk about. Difficult for us to listen to,\" she said of the interview. \"Just difficult all around, heart-wrenching. He's doing so much better, but it's such a terrible situation.\"\n\n\n\nDenver Jarvis and Matthew Bent, both 15, are accused along with a third teen, Jesus Mendez, 16, of being in a group that poured alcohol over Brewer and set him ablaze in a dispute over $40, a video game and a bicycle. All three pleaded not guilty in an appearance last week in Broward County Circuit Court. If"}

{"question": "Which state official has not signed the Arizona bill?", "answers": ["Gov. Jan Brewer."], "context": "(CNN) -- Now that Arizona lawmakers have passed what's considered some of the toughest immigration legislation in the country, other states are watching to see whether they should follow in the state's footsteps or stand back.\n\n\n\n\n\nArizona's bill orders immigrants to carry their alien registration documents at all times and requires police to question people if there's reason to suspect they're in the United States illegally. It also targets those who hire illegal immigrant day laborers or knowingly transport them.\n\n\n\n\n\nCritics, including immigrant advocates and the American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona, are concerned that the legislation will foster racial profiling, arguing that most police officers don't have enough training to look past race while investigating a person's legal status.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bill made it through the state Senate on Monday after it was passed by the state House last week. It's now awaiting the signature of Republican Gov. Jan Brewer. Supporters of the measure expect her to sign it. Latino members of Congress are calling on Brewer to veto it.\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael Hethmon, general counsel for the Immigration Reform Law Institute, helped draft the language of the Arizona bill. The institute is the legal affiliate of the Federation for American Immigration Reform.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the heels of the Arizona initiative, Hethmon said he has been approached by lawmakers from four other states who have asked for advice on how they can do the same thing where they live. He declined to identify the states, citing attorney-client privilege.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Arizona was meant to be the leading edge,\" Hethmon said. \"If you are going to work on developing a state-based response to this enormous problem -- the lack of a national immigration policy -- Arizona is the place to do it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHethmon pointed to Arizona's history of citizen ballot initiatives in support of immigration reform, noting that \"what's happening in Arizona just didn't pop out of nowhere. It's the latest step in a fairly deliberate process.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRepublican State Rep. Russell Pearce, who sponsored the legislation in Arizona, said the four initiatives he put on the 2006 ballot regarding illegal immigrants passed by an average of 75 percent.\n\n\n\n\n\nState laws relating to immigration have increased in recent years, according to numbers from the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2005, 300 bills were introduced. The next year, that number nearly doubled, and in 2007, more than 1,500 bills were introduced. Another 1,305 were introduced in 2008, and about 1,500 were considered in 2009.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout 15 percent of those were enacted, dealing with issues such as driver's licenses, health and education.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout1,000 bills have been brought up so far this year.\n\n\n\n\n\nHethmon cited the election year, the Democratic leadership's position on the issue and the tough economic times as catalysts for introducing legislation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Historically, not only in the U.S. but in virtually all industrialized nations, when the unemployment rates go up ... the public becomes much less sympathetic toward programs which bring in large numbers of foreigners as workers and economic players,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether Arizona becomes the standard-bearer on illegal immigration depends on the fate of the legislation, said Ann Morse, the program director of the National Conference of State Legislatures' Immigrant Policy Project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Certainly states will look at it, but not in a rush,\" she said. With court challenges promised from opponents, states will be watching to see if the legislation is deemed constitutional and if it's costly, Morse said.\n\n\n\n\n\nOmar Jadwat, the staff attorney with the ACLU's Immigrants Rights' Project, said following in Arizona's footsteps would take states in the wrong direction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Although we are aware that people are trying to convince other legislatures to go down this path, I think it's clear that both as a policy matter and a legal matter, that Arizona's approach is the wrong one,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIsabel Garcia, a legal defender in Arizona's Pima County, blasted the bill as \"the most dangerous precedent in this country, violating all of our due process rights.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have not seen this kind of legislation since the Jim"}
{"question": "How many suspects are there?", "answers": ["At least 13"], "context": "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistani authorities have launched a massive crackdown on terror groups that they say were planning numerous suicide attacks, including in the country's largest city of Karachi.\n\n\n\nPakistan security officials show seized weapons and ammunition in Karachi on Sunday after the arrest of seven alleged militants.\n\n\n\nAt least 13 suspects were arrested Sunday and Monday, including three people carrying suicide jackets and explosives inside a bus station, a police official said.\n\n\n\nThe three were seized early Monday after police raided a bus station in Sargodha, a city located about 120 miles (190 km) south of Islamabad in Pakistan's Punjab province.\n\n\n\nThe suspects were plotting to attack two Shiite mosques, police stations, and a Norwegian telecommunications company in Punjab, according to district police officer Usman Anwar. Three other suspects linked to the plot were arrested hours later in Sargodha, he said.\n\n\n\nThose arrested early Monday included the Pakistani Taliban's chief in Punjab, according to Anwar.\n\n\n\nThe Taliban in Punjab have direct ties to Baitullah Mehsud, the former head of the Pakistan Taliban, and have been accused of sectarian murders in Punjab. Pakistan and U.S. officials contend Mehsud was killed in an August 5 drone attack in Waziristan at his father-in-law's house. The Taliban claim Mehsud is alive but ill.\n\n\n\nHakeemullah Mehsud has been selected as the new head of the Pakistani Taliban, a Taliban commander said Saturday.\n\n\n\nPakistani authorities also said they thwarted planned attacks in the southern port city of Karachi, Pakistan's largest city and the capital of Sindh province.\n\n\n\nSeven members of a banned militant group with strong ties to al Qaeda and the Taliban were arrested Sunday along with suicide vests and a large quantity of ammunition, according to the city's police superintendent Mohammed Fayyaz Khan\n\n\n\nThe group, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, was planning to conduct attacks in Karachi, according to Karachi Police Chief Waseem Ahmad.\n\n\n\nLashkar-e-Jhangvi is considered a terrorist group by the U.S. State Department, and was banned by then-Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf in 2001. It is described as Pakistan's \"most extreme and feared militant group\" by IHS Jane's, a provider of defense and security information. The banned Sunni militant group, which began in the 1990s, is a \"key ally\" of the Taliban and al Qaeda, according to Jane's.\n\n\n\n\"However, many of its leaders and members have been killed or jailed in recent years and there is little evidence that it remains a coherent organization with centralized structures,\" Jane's said in an assessment released earlier this month.\n\n\n\nLashkar-e-Jhangvi is blamed for the attempted assassination of former Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in 1999, and the assassination of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in 2007.\n\n\n\nThe group also has also been linked to the March attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team in the Pakistani city of Lahore.\n\n\n\nThe recent arrests in Karachi and in Punjab are part of a broader crackdown on terror groups that have extended their reach outside Pakistan's volatile North West Frontier Province and adjacent tribal regions. That is where Pakistani security forces continue to battle a strong Taliban presence.\n\n\n\nTaliban militants maintained strongholds within 100 miles of the capital, Islamabad, before Pakistani security forces pushed them back this year.\n\n\n\nA month ago, Pakistani authorities unraveled a militant plot to target government buildings in Islamabad with suicide attackers, according to Interior Minister Rehmen Malik.\n\n\n\nThree bombers were detained, and along with them suicide vests packed with complex explosives surrounded by ball bearings that would kill anyone within 50 to 100 meters.\n\n\n\n\"They had the live jackets ... they were staying in one house and they had hidden the suicide jackets not far from that (house) in the hills,\" Malik told CNN. \"Obviously they had a plan in Islamabad because Islamabad is the icon of the country.\"\n\n\n\nHe said they first planned to target parliament, then move on to other prominent government buildings in the capital city.\n\n\n\nHitting back at the government would seem to be a high priority for the newly appointed leader of the Pakistani Taliban.

{"question": "Who is accused of killing him?", "answers": ["88-year-old white supremacist"], "context": "(CNN) -- After stints as a guard in the jails of Washington, D.C., and on the streets of post-Katrina New Orleans, Stephen Tyrone Johns had settled in to a job he liked at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, family members said.\n\n\n\nSecurity officer Stephen Johns reportedly opened the door for the man police say was his killer.\n\n\n\n\"It seemed to be kind of laid-back -- it didn't seem to be that dangerous,\" Leroy Carter, the stepfather who helped raise Johns since he was 3, told CNN affiliate WUSA-TV in Washington. \"He had wanted to be on the Metro Police force or places like that, but I would have rather him been where he was.\n\n\n\n\"But it just backfired.\"\n\n\n\nJohns, 39, was shot and killed while on duty Wednesday -- allegedly gunned down by an 88-year-old white supremacist who stepped into the museum with a rifle and began firing.\n\n\n\nJohns is remembered by friends and family as a \"gentle giant\" -- he stood 6 feet 6 inches, according to Carter. And he lived up to the moniker to the very end.\n\n\n\nOne of his last acts was reaching out and opening the door for the man who shot him, police said.  Watch museum officials pay tribute »\n\n\n\nJames von Brunn, an outspoken Holocaust denier who had served six years in prison for a 1981 kidnapping attempt, was shot and wounded by Johns' fellow officers. He remained in critical condition Thursday at George Washington University Hospital.\n\n\n\nJohns, a six-year veteran of the museum's security staff, was a resident and native of Temple Hills, Maryland.\n\n\n\nIn the hours following the shooting, friends and co-workers repeatedly remembered \"Big John\" for his quiet, friendly nature.\n\n\n\n\"To look at him initially he was very intimidating,\" said Alan Burkee, a friend and former co-worker at the museum. \"But he was very shy. ... He had a great demeanor -- very pleasant, very courteous to all the visitors that came in and the staff that worked there.\"\n\n\n\nFriends said Johns was an avid Washington Redskins fan and loved to travel, but lived just 10 minutes away from where his mother and stepfather raised him.\n\n\n\nHe had an 11-year-old son, Stephen Jr., and recently had remarried, according to friends.\n\n\n\n\"He was a pretty great guy,\" Stephen Johns Jr., known as \"Little Stephen\" to family, told WUSA. \"He was always there for me when I was down or sad.\"\n\n\n\nCarter had picked up Stephen after school to tell him the news of the shooting, and the two were on the way to the hospital when Johns died.\n\n\n\nSteve Maritas is organizing director with the International Union of Security, Police and Fire Professionals of America -- of which Johns was a member.\n\n\n\nHe said the way Johns and his fellow officers responded Wednesday saved lives -- and it flies in the face of the stereotype of the run-of-the-mill security guard.\n\n\n\n\"If that was the case, there would have been 50 people shot yesterday,\" said Maritas, whose organization represents more than 30,000 officers nationally and about 5,000 in the Washington area.\n\n\n\n\"These guys are very highly trained, highly paid officers. It's not like they're just there wearing a uniform.\"\n\n\n\nJohns had worked for Wackenhut Security Inc. since 2003.\n\n\n\nMaritas said Johns and his colleagues trained for days like Wednesday -- when years of safety and quiet give way to a sudden burst of terror.\n\n\n\n\"Hopefully, you'll never have to use your gun,\" he said. \"But you get a situation where you get a crazy guy like this -- it happens within two or three seconds.\"\n\n\n\nFor Carter, there will always a clear reminder of the stepson he raised as his own. Little Stephen, he said, looks and acts just like his father did at that age.\n\n\n\nCarter said he takes comfort knowing that the roughly 2,000 people visiting the Holocaust museum at the time of the attack were able"}

{"question": "Newspapers come is various sizes, broadsheet being the largest, and tabloid being smaller, but what name is given to the smallest size.", "answers": ["compact"], "context": "Tabloid (newspaper format)A tabloid is a newspaper with compact page size smaller than broadsheet, although there is no standard for the precise dimensions of the tabloid newspaper format.  The term tabloid journalism, along with the use of large pictures, tends to emphasize topics such as sensational crime stories, astrology, celebrity gossip and television. However, some reputable newspapers, such as The Times, are in tabloid format, and this size is used in the United Kingdom by nearly all local newspapers. There, its page dimensions are roughly 430 ×. In the United States, it is commonly the format employed by alternative newspapers. Some small-format papers which claim a higher standard of journalism refer to themselves as compact newspapers instead. \n Larger newspapers, traditionally associated with higher-quality journalism, are often called broadsheets, and this designation often remains in common usage even if the newspaper moves to printing on smaller pages, as many have in recent years.  Thus the terms tabloid and broadsheet are, in non-technical usage, today more descriptive of a newspaper's market position than its physical size. \n The Berliner format used by many prominent European newspapers is sized between the tabloid and the broadsheet. In a newspaper context, the term Berliner is generally used only to describe size, not to refer to other qualities of the publication. \n History \n The word \"tabloid\" comes from the name given by the London-based pharmaceutical company Burroughs Wellcome & Co. to the compressed tablets they marketed as \"Tabloid\" pills in the late 1880s.   The connotation of tabloid was soon applied to other small compressed items. A 1902 item in London's Westminister Gazette noted, \"The proprietor intends to give in tabloid form all the news printed by other journals.\"  Thus \"tabloid journalism\" in 1901 originally meant a paper that condensed stories into a simplified, easily absorbed format. The term preceded the 1918 reference to smaller sheet newspapers that contained the condensed stories.  \n Dimensions \n A tabloid is defined as \"roughly 17 by\" and commonly \"half the size of a broadsheet\". \n Types \n Tabloid newspapers, especially in the United Kingdom, boast a very high degree of variation as far as target market, political alignment, editorial style, and circulation are concerned.  Thus, various terms have been coined to describe the subtypes of this versatile paper format.  There are, broadly, two main types of tabloid newspaper: red top and compact.  The distinction is largely of editorial style; both red top and compact tabloids span the width of the political spectrum from socialism to capitalist conservatism.  Red top tabloids are so named due to their tendency, in British and Commonwealth usage, to have their mastheads printed in red ink; the term compact was coined to avoid the connotation of the word tabloid, which implies a red top tabloid, and has lent its name to tabloid journalism, which is journalism after the fashion of red top reporters. \n Red top tabloids \n The red top tabloid is, for many, the prototypical example of the format; the ubiquity of this editorial style among newspapers of the tabloid format has made it persist in the minds of the public.  Red top tabloids, named after their distinguishing red mastheads, employ a form of writing known as tabloid journalism; this style emphasizes features such as sensational crime stories, astrology, gossip columns about the personal lives of celebrities and sports stars, and junk food news.  Celebrity gossip columns which appear in red top tabloids and focus on their sexual practices, misuse of narcotics, and the private aspects of their lives often border on, and sometimes cross the line of, defamation. \n Red tops tend to be written with a simplistic, straightforward vocabulary and grammar; their layout, more often than not, gives greater prominence to the picture than to the word.

Missouri police did not have Mohler in custody earlier.\n\n\n\nOn the request of Missouri officials, Marion County authorities went to Mohler's home in Silver Springs, Florida, and caught him just before he pulled into the driveway, according to a news release from the Marion County Sheriff's Office. He was subsequently arrested.\n\n\n\nMohler told police he \"was aware of what was going on in Missouri,\" and that he had not been there since the 1980s, according to the sheriff's office.\n\n\n\nFive members of the Mohler family of Lafayette County, Missouri, were arrested earlier this week after six alleged victims, who are relatives of the five suspects, made accusations of sexual abuse. A sixth person, described as an \"associate\" of the family, was arrested Thursday but released Friday, police said.\n\n\n\nThe six alleged victims -- all now adults -- came to law enforcement authorities with stories of sexual performances, mock weddings, rape with various objects and a forced abortion during their childhoods, according to court documents obtained by CNN affiliate KSHB in Kansas City. CNN does not identify alleged sexual assault victims.\n\n\n\nPolice did not have enough to charge Darrel Mohler earlier, but after examining the victims' statements, obtained enough information to charge him, Alumbaugh said. He added that he does not think Darrel is on the run.\n\n\n\nDarrel Mohler, 72, is the younger brother of Burrell Edward Mohler Sr., 77, according to KSHB. On Tuesday, authorities arrested Mohler Sr. and his sons Burrell Edward Mohler Jr., 53; David A. Mohler, 52; Jared Leroy Mohler, 48; and Roland Neil Mohler, 47.\n\n\n\nMore charges against the family members are expected next week, the sheriff said. Current charges for some of the arrested include rape, deviate sexual assault and use [of] child in sexual performance, according to Missouri State Courts online case management system.\n\n\n\nAlumbaugh said that Larry Kidd, 55, of Kansas City, Missouri -- an \"associate\" of the Mohler family -- was picked up by police following a tip, cooperated with police and has been released.\n\n\n\nThe alleged abuse took place from the mid-1980s until 1995 and possibly beyond, the sheriff said earlier. The documents provide graphic details of the alleged abuse provided by one of the alleged victims. All of the charges stem from those documents, Alumbaugh said.\n\n\n\nMohler Sr., David Mohler and Jared Mohler are all lay ministers in the Community of Christ, the Independence, Missouri-based organization said in a statement.\n\n\n\nLay ministers are volunteers who do not receive compensation, said the organization, and none of the three served in leadership roles or worked with children.\n\n\n\nMohler Sr. went through the group's registered youth worker program, but \"his youth worker registration has been terminated and we understand he had no contact with children or youth in church programs,\" the statement said.\n\n\n\nSome lay ministers might help take care of the church, while others might speak at services, said the organization's spokeswoman, Linda Booth.\n\n\n\nThe Community of Christ is an offshoot of the modern-day Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It split off from the Mormon church in the 1800s, and in 2000 changed its name to Community of Christ from the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\n\n\nInvestigators earlier this week searched several properties for evidence, but there were no plans to continue the searches, Alumbaugh said Friday. He declined to comment on any evidence found.\n\n\n\nCNN's Sara Weisfeldt contributed to this report."}

Mann, Raymond S. Bradley and Malcolm K. Hughes (MBH99), which has been referred to as the \"hockey stick graph\". This graph extended the similar graph in Figure 3.20 from the IPCC Second Assessment Report of 1995, and differed from a schematic in the first assessment report that lacked temperature units, but appeared to depict larger global temperature variations over the past 1000 years, and higher temperatures during the Medieval Warm Period than the mid 20th century. The schematic was not an actual plot of data, and was based on a diagram of temperatures in central England, with temperatures increased on the basis of documentary evidence of Medieval vineyards in England. Even with this increase, the maximum it showed for the Medieval Warm Period did not reach temperatures recorded in central England in 2007.

The EU's primary constitutional sources are the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which have been agreed or adhered to among the governments of all 28 member states. The Treaties establish the EU's institutions, list their powers and responsibilities, and explain the areas in which the EU can legislate with Directives or Regulations. The European Commission has the initiative to propose legislation.

The Commission oversees departments and various agencies that execute or enforce EU law. The \"European Council\" (rather than the Council, made up of different government Ministers) is composed of the Prime Ministers or executive Presidents of the member states. It appoints the Commissioners and the board of the European Central Bank. The European Court of Justice is the supreme judicial body which interprets EU law, and develops it through precedent.

A bevy of ancient, bikini-clad babes are depicted playing sports.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Earlier this year, Brooklyn-based designer Andrew Schneider invented the first solar powered bikini -- the \"iKini\" -- which produces enough electricity to power an iPod during a sunny day at the beach. Just remember to unplug it, the inventor says, before taking a dip.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. The famous white belted bikini worn by Ursula Andress in the 1962 James Bond hit \"Dr. No\" sold for $61,500 at Christie's in London in 2001. Halle Barry modeled a redux of a similar suit in the 2002 Bond flick, \"Die Another Day.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n4. French designer Jacques Heim's first itsy-bitsy bathing suit hit the fashion scene in 1946. Tapping into the worldwide obsession with nuclear physics, he named his tiny invention the \"atom.\" A few months later, another French designer, Louis Reard, one-upped Heim, revealing an even tinier suit, which he dubbed the \"bikini\" after Bikini Atoll, the island in the Pacific where the U.S. had tested the atom bomb. The new swimsuit, it was said, was as small as an atom and just as powerful.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Reard said a two-piece bathing suit couldn't be called a bikini \"unless it could be pulled through a wedding ring.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Floss: Waitresses, bridesmaids, compulsory plastic surgery\n\n\n\n\n\n6. In 2009, Americans spent $4.3 billion -- roughly $400 million more than the GDP of Barbados -- on swimwear alone.\n\n\n\n\n\n7. The 19th-century version of a bikini was made out of either heavy flannel or wool -- fabrics that would not be transparent when wet -- and covered the entire body from neck to toe. The suits were so heavy that women had to hold onto ropes strung from the beach to offshore buoys to keep from sinking.\n\n\n\n\n\n8. The bikini rocketed to fame in 1960 with Brian Hyland's hit single, \"Itsy Bitsy Teeny Weeny Yellow Polka Dot Bikini.\" The famous 30 inches of fabric didn't debut on the cover of Sports Illustrated until 1964.\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Floss: 25 brand names mistakenly used as generic terms\n\n\n\n\n\n9. At the 1964 International Beauty Pageant in Long Beach, California, Miss Austria stormed out of a photoshoot after being told she could not wear her homemade bikini. \"Americans are rude,\" she said. \"I'm tanned all over, so I wanted the suntan to show.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n10. In 2009, a group of vegetarian ladies campaigned in international cities wearing bikinis made only of lettuce leaves. The \"Lettuce Ladies\" as they were called, were sponsored by the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, and hoped to convince people to adopt a meatless diet.\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Floss: When did women start shaving their armpits?\n\n\n\n\n\n11. In 1993, the Olympic Committee decreed the bikini the official uniform for women's beach volleyball, partly because of the functionality of the suit. Athletes complain that when wearing more conventional uniform -- the one-piece, for instance -- \"sand goes down the top and collects in the bottom,\" Holly McPeak, a three-time Olympic vollyballer told ABC News.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the bikini's built-in sand-release system, Reard, it seems, was ahead of his time.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com"}

{"question": "What is another way of referring to stators?", "answers": ["static discs", "static discs)", "static discs"], "context": "A steam turbine consists of one or more rotors (rotating discs) mounted on a drive shaft, alternating with a series of stators (static discs) fixed to the turbine casing. The rotors have a propeller-like arrangement of blades at the outer edge. Steam acts upon these blades, producing rotary motion. The stator consists of a similar, but fixed, series of blades that serve to redirect the steam flow onto the next rotor stage. A steam turbine often exhausts into a surface condenser that provides a vacuum. The stages of a steam turbine are typically arranged to extract the maximum potential work from a specific velocity and pressure of steam, giving rise to a series of variably sized high- and low-pressure stages. Turbines are only efficient if they rotate at relatively high speed, therefore they are usually connected to reduction gearing to drive lower speed applications, such as a ship's propeller. In the vast majority of large electric generating stations, turbines are directly connected to generators with no reduction gearing. Typical speeds are 3600 revolutions per minute (RPM) in the USA with 60 Hertz power, 3000 RPM in Europe and other countries with 50 Hertz electric power systems. In nuclear power applications the turbines typically run at half these speeds, 1800 RPM and 1500 RPM. A turbine rotor is also only capable of providing power when rotating in one direction. Therefore, a reversing stage or gearbox is usually required where power is required in the opposite direction.[citation needed]"}
{"question": "The Hawaiian Islands are made up almost entirely of what?", "answers": ["layered basaltic lava flows", "layered basaltic lava flows", "layered basaltic lava flows"], "context": "All of these processes do not necessarily occur in a single environment, and do not necessarily occur in a single order. The Hawaiian Islands, for example, consist almost entirely of layered basaltic lava flows. The sedimentary sequences of the mid-continental United States and the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States contain almost-undeformed stacks of sedimentary rocks that have remained in place since Cambrian time. Other areas are much more geologically complex. In the southwestern United States, sedimentary, volcanic, and intrusive rocks have been metamorphosed, faulted, foliated, and folded. Even older rocks, such as the Acasta gneiss of the Slave craton in northwestern Canada, the oldest known rock in the world have been metamorphosed to the point where their origin is undiscernable without laboratory analysis. In addition, these processes can occur in stages. In many places, the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States being a very visible example, the lower rock units were metamorphosed and deformed, and then deformation ended and the upper, undeformed units were deposited. Although any amount of rock emplacement and rock deformation can occur, and they can occur any number of times, these concepts provide a guide to understanding the geological history of an area."}

I’m not talking about the electronic organiser that caused the recent Barack Obama controvery . Not that I didn’t have issues of my own when it came to putting a blackberry plant in our bramble row. When we bought our block at Icy Creek five years ago, the paddocks were two metres high with these prickly pests of plants, and we’re still fighting to keep them at bay. But the Thornless Blackberry plant I bought at a nursery will not, I’m assured, take hold of the region. And if only grows as half as well as its wild cousins we should have enough fruit for blackberry icecream next summer. That’s providing we don’t pull them out by accident. \n Our other newcomer, the Thornless Youngberry  is a domesticated version of a berry that was itself first cultivated in the US in 1905. I’ve read that this variety doesn’t fruit quite as prolifically as the thorny youngberry , but with any luck it will be fully productive within three years. \n I’ve put both plants in a row with several two year-old jostaberry plants and a sprawling loganberry for company. \n There’s a huge range of blackberries and related soft fruit varieties on the market these days, and this excellent piece from the  TyTy Nursery in Georgia helps explain how they’ve been engineered into existence. Did you know, for instance that “the “Youngberry “was developed in 1905 in Morgan City, Louisiana; it is a cross between Luther Burbank’s, Phenomenal Berry, and the Austin-Mayes Dewberry , a trailing blackberry. This berry had excellent qualities, such as taste and high yields, and it soon replaced the Loganberry of California after its release”? Who would have thought? \n I am on a bit of a learning curve when it comes to bramble berries, and so I’m keen to hear from anyone who has had success with a particular variety, or who can suggest what else we might want to try bunging in the ground, bearing in mind we’re a cool climate location about the same latitude as Melbourne, but 500 metres above sea level. \n Like this:  Youngberries Information, Recipes and FactsYoungberries Information, Recipes and Facts \n   \n Description/Taste \n Youngberries look more similar to Boysenberries than they do their ancestral Blackberries.

(An album, \"Love,\" came out last year.)\n\n\"Paul and I went to listen to the music in 5.1 and we go 'Whoa, listen to that,' \" Starr said. \"You know you can hear everything now. Things that we buried a lot. It's all very clear, so it's really great to hear it.\"\n\n\"Most historic stuff goes down with age, you know?\" McCartney added. \"Winston Churchill's old papers go brown and crinkly, while our music gets brighter and shinier.\"\n\n\"Next year, it will be 10.1,\" Starr joked.\n\nMcCartney's latest solo album, \"Memory's Almost Full,\" is No. 3  on the album charts and Starr is scheduled to release a greatest hits album in August.

She had been incarcerated at the California Institution for Women in Corona, California, but has been hospitalized since mid-March.\n\n\n\nHer request is now before the Board of Parole Hearings, which is conducting an independent investigation and will hear the case during its monthly public meeting, Thornton said. The next meeting is scheduled July 15.\n\n\n\nAtkins had been held for years at the Corona prison, which earlier determined that she met the criteria for compassionate release under the law, and sent her request to the corrections department.\n\n\n\nThe Board of Parole Hearings will receive public comment, discuss the request in closed session and then announce its recommendation. The board also can decide whether to refer the request to the sentencing court.\n\n\n\nThe court, based in Los Angeles, can either grant or deny Atkins' request. It also can recall her life sentence and resentence Atkins to a lesser term, allowing for her to be paroled.\n\n\n\nIn 2007, the department received 60 compassionate release requests, Thornton said. Ten were approved.\n\n\n\nCiting privacy rules, prison officials would not disclose the nature of Atkins' illness. Her husband and attorney, James Whitehouse, has been quoted as saying she has terminal brain cancer, according to a blog called Manson Family Today. She also has had a leg amputated, the Los Angeles Times has reported.\n\n\n\nAtkins, known within the Manson family as \"Sadie Mae Glutz,\" has been in prison since 1971 and has been denied parole 11 times. She is California's longest-serving female inmate.\n\n\n\nTate and three houseguests were slain in August 1969 by killers who burst into her Benedict Canyon home. A teenager who was visiting the home's caretaker in his cottage on the property also was killed.\n\n\n\nAccording to historical accounts of the murders, Atkins stabbed Tate, who was 8½ months pregnant, and wrote the word \"pig\" in blood on the door of the home the actress shared with her husband, director Roman Polanski.\n\n\n\nThe following night, Leno and Rosemary LaBianca were slain in their home in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles. The two-day crime spree sent shock waves throughout Los Angeles.\n\n\n\nAll of the killers remain behind bars. Atkins also was convicted in the earlier murder of music teacher Gary Hinman.\n\n\n\nAtkins, like family leader Charles Manson, received a death sentence. Her punishment was changed to life in prison when the California Supreme Court ruled the state's death penalty unconstitutional in 1972.\n\n\n\nAtkins is a born-again Christian, according to a Web site maintained by her husband. During her incarceration, the site says, Atkins has worked to help at-risk youth, victims of violent crimes and homeless children.\n\n\n\nLast month, authorities dug for buried bodies at the Inyo County, California, ranch where Manson and his followers once lived, after police became aware that testing had indicated humans might be buried there.

Other strategies will include holding Afghan government leaders accountable for corruption, focus assistance on areas that could help the lives of Afghans, and securing the country's border with Pakistan.\n\n\n\n\"We are in Afghanistan to prevent a cancer from once again spreading through that country. But this same cancer has also taken root in the border region of Pakistan.

The Pentagon is planning to add 6,000 troops by the end of the year.\n\n\n\nThere have been indications that Obama soon could be asked to commit even more American troops. Defense Secretary Robert Gates, however, has signaled he would like to gauge the impact of the 6,000-troop increase before considering whether to send more.\n\n\n\nSupport in the United States for the war in Afghanistan has dipped to an all-time low. Just 39 percent of Americans favor the war, while 58 percent oppose it, according to a national CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey released Tuesday.\n\n\n\nRecent polling suggests that the increasing violence and slow pace of progress are also taking a toll on support for the war in Canada.\n\n\n\nObama thanked Harper for his country's commitment to Afghanistan, where more than 2,800 Canadian troops and dozens of civilians are stationed.\n\n\n\n\"They have fought; they have had staying power; they have absorbed losses that we all grieve for,\" he said.  Watch Obama and Harper meet »\n\n\n\nMost of the Canadian forces are based in the southern Kandahar province, home to some of the worst violence and instability. At least 130 Canadian troops have been killed in the war.\n\n\n\nLast year, after a national debate, the Canadian government extended the mission -- which was to end this February -- until the end of 2011.\n\n\n\nHarper said Wednesday that \"Canada is not leaving Afghanistan\" but is \"transitioning from a predominately military mission to a mission that will be a civilian humanitarian mission after 2011.\"\n\n\n\nThe two leaders also discussed economic issues, issuing a joint statement after their meeting saying in part that \"open trade and investment are essential for competitiveness and sustainable growth in North America and globally.\"\n\n\n\nObama acknowledged that the \"Buy American\" clause in the economic stimulus package has been a \"source of irritation\" between Canada and the United States and is something Harper has repeatedly brought to his attention.\n\n\n\nThe clause is a provision in the $787 billion stimulus package enacted in February that states only American goods can be used in stimulus projects. But it stipulates that the measure would not override existing U.S. trade treaties such as the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n\n\n\nHarper said Canada's concerns about the clause are \"important irritants ... but relatively small\" when compared with the overall U.S.-Canadian trade relationship."}
{"question": "'Spring' and 'Rhenish' are the popular names given to symphonies by which composer?", "answers": ["robert schumann"], "context": "SCHUMANN - The Symphonies Linn CKD450 [ST] Classical Music ...SCHUMANN - The Symphonies Linn CKD450 [ST] Classical Music Reviews: October 2014 - MusicWeb-International \n Support us financially by purchasing this from \n Robert SCHUMANN (1810-1856) \n Symphony No. 1 in B flat Spring [32:36] \n Symphony No. 2 in C [38:22] \n Symphony No. 3 in E flat Rhenish [32:48] \n Symphony No. 4 in D minor [29:35] \n Scottish Chamber Orchestra/Robin Ticciati \n rec. Perth Concert Hall, November-December 2013 \n LINN CKD450 SACD [70:59 + 62:25] \n With complete sets from Simon Rattle and from Yannick Nezet-Seguin, this is turning out to be quite the year for Schumann symphonies. However, this new set from Robin Ticciati and the Scottish Chamber Orchestra elbows those two aside and takes its place towards the very top of the list of recommendations for these works, in this year or in any other. Concerts of the complete set took pride of place in the SCO’s programme for autumn 2013: I found them very impressive then , and these CDs only serve to reinforce that impression of quality. \n   \n Robin Ticciati’s work with the Scottish Chamber Orchestra has been characterised by precise attention to detail and real care for the colour of the sound. His great achievement with the Schumann symphonies is that he peels back the Romantic patina of the years and reminds us that these are symphonies from the early half of the nineteenth century. As John Worthen’s booklet notes point out, Beethoven had been dead for only fourteen years by the time of Schumann’s first symphony, and the heavy encrusting that would befall much orchestral music was still a long way in the future. Here, therefore, we hear Schumann’s thoughts stripped of the weight that would later lie on their shoulders and would, I suspect, be the source of the accusation that Schumann was a poor orchestrator. With forces of this size and skill, that allegation simply evaporates. Not a moment sounds unbalanced or out of sync. Instead Ticciati and his musicians have found a way of presenting Schumann’s symphonic world with openness, brightness and superb clarity. \n   \n As a part of this, Ticciati is light on his feet in his interpretations. Tempi are on the fast side, and this means that the clarity of attack which characterises his readings is realised to its very fullest potential. There is great precision on display here, and the thwacks that end the Rhenish are only the most exciting example. Listen, for example, to the brilliant trumpet triplets that punctuate the scherzo sections of the Spring’s third movement or the light-as-a-feather articulation of the Fourth’s finale. \n   \n He conducts with the long view in mind and never plays things for a quick thrill. The fanfare that opens the Spring symphony, for example, seems to grow with each passing note, and the entire movement builds up to that fanfare’s majestic reappearance in the recapitulation. Then, however, Ticciati surprises you with a beautifully tender rendition of the violin line in the coda, a beautiful moment that I had never really noticed before. Similarly, the introduction to No. 2 is pregnant with anticipation, spilling into a rhythmically buoyant account of that first movement that bristles with quiet energy. He also plays delicately with the rhythm at times, such as a tiny holding back in the finale of the Spring symphony that adds bags of character. \n   \n The orchestra match him with a carefully textured sound that is both light and flexible. The strings play with minimal vibrato, thus giving them a thinner sound than in big symphony orchestra recordings, but that also makes them more flexible and prone to feats of great agility. Listen, for example, to the sprightly manner in which they tackle the main theme of the Fourth’s opening movement. They can be used to great theatrical effect too, however, such as in the solemn slow movement of the Rhenish where they sound even slightly emaciated: this evocation of the cathedral brings to mind penitence and mourning rather than mere scene-setting. There can be a slightly stringy"}

During the first years after the war, the population growth was c. 6%, so shortly the city started to suffer from the lack of flats and of areas for new houses. The first remedial measure was the Warsaw area enlargement (1951) – but the city authorities were still forced to introduce residency registration limitations: only the spouses and children of the permanent residents as well as some persons of public importance (like renowned specialists) were allowed to get the registration, hence halving the population growth in the following years. It also bolstered some kind of conviction among Poles that Varsovians thought of themselves as better only because they lived in the capital. Unfortunately this belief still lives on in Poland (although not as much as it used to be) – even though since 1990 there are no limitations to residency registration anymore."}

{"question": "What did Mongolian President Tsakhiagian Elbegdorj note was significantly punished by Genghis Khan's laws?", "answers": ["corruption and bribery", "corruption and bribery", "corruption and bribery"], "context": "Genghis Khan is regarded as one of the prominent leaders in Mongolia's history. He is responsible for the emergence of the Mongols as a political and ethnic identity because there was no unified identity between the tribes that had cultural similarity. He reinforced many Mongol traditions and provided stability and unity during a time of almost endemic warfare between tribes. He is also given credit for the introduction of the traditional Mongolian script and the creation of the Ikh Zasag (Great Administration), the first written Mongolian law. \"Ikh Zasag law adopted during Genghis Khan’s time in Mongolia had points to punish illegal matters related to corruption and bribery very heavily,\" Mongolian President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj noted. President Elbegdorj sees Genghis Khan as a leader from whom to learn for anti-corruption efforts as Genghis Khan sought equal protection under the law for all citizens regardless of status or wealth. \"Chinggis (Genghis Khan)...was a man who deeply realized that the justice begins and consolidates with the equality of law, and not with the distinctions between people. He was a man who knew that the good laws and rules lived longer than fancy palaces,\" Elbegdorj said in his speech on the 850th anniversary of Chinggis Khaan's birth. In summary, Mongolians see him as the fundamental figure in the founding of the Mongol Empire and therefore the basis for Mongolia as a country."}
{"question": "How long did the state exist whose army ransacked and looted the city, Halebidu, twice in the 14th century ?", "answers": ["320 years"], "context": "Halebidu  Halebeedu (literally \"old capital\") is a town located in Hassan District, Karnataka, India.  Halebidu (which used to be called Dorasamudra or Dwarasamudra) was the regal capital of the Hoysala Empire in the 12th century.  It is home to some of the best examples of Hoysala architecture.  Most notable are the ornate Hoysaleshwara and Kedareshwara temples.  The city got the name \"Halebidu\" because it was damaged and deserted into \"old capital\" after being ransacked and looted twice by north Indian Muslim armies of the Delhi Sultanate in the 14th-century. \n  Delhi Sultanate  The Delhi Sultanate was a Muslim sultanate based mostly in Delhi that stretched over large parts of the Indian subcontinent for 320 years (1206–1526).  Five dynasties ruled over the Delhi Sultanate sequentially: the Mamluk dynasty (1206–90), the Khalji dynasty (1290–1320), the Tughlaq dynasty (1320–1414), the Sayyid dynasty (1414–51), and the Lodi dynasty (1451–1526).  Three dynasties (Mamluk, Khalji and Sayyid) were of Turkic origin, one dynasty (Tughlaq) was of Turko-Indian origin, and the last dynasty (Lodi) was of Pashtun origin.  The sultanate is noted for being one of the few states to repel an attack by the Mongol Empire, and enthroned one of the few female rulers in Islamic history, Razia Sultana, who reigned from 1236 to 1240."}

{"question": "The rocks at the Grand Canyon have been in place since when?", "answers": ["Cambrian time", "Cambrian time", "Cambrian time"], "context": "All of these processes do not necessarily occur in a single environment, and do not necessarily occur in a single order. The Hawaiian Islands, for example, consist almost entirely of layered basaltic lava flows. The sedimentary sequences of the mid-continental United States and the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States contain almost-undeformed stacks of sedimentary rocks that have remained in place since Cambrian time. Other areas are much more geologically complex. In the southwestern United States, sedimentary, volcanic, and intrusive rocks have been metamorphosed, faulted, foliated, and folded. Even older rocks, such as the Acasta gneiss of the Slave craton in northwestern Canada, the oldest known rock in the world have been metamorphosed to the point where their origin is undiscernable without laboratory analysis. In addition, these processes can occur in stages. In many places, the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States being a very visible example, the lower rock units were metamorphosed and deformed, and then deformation ended and the upper, undeformed units were deposited. Although any amount of rock emplacement and rock deformation can occur, and they can occur any number of times, these concepts provide a guide to understanding the geological history of an area."}

{"question": "When the law is a direct target of the protest, what is this called?", "answers": ["direct civil disobedience", "direct civil disobedience", "direct civil disobedience", "direct civil disobedience", "direct civil disobedience"], "context": "Courts have distinguished between two types of civil disobedience: \"Indirect civil disobedience involves violating a law which is not, itself, the object of protest, whereas direct civil disobedience involves protesting the existence of a particular law by breaking that law.\" During the Vietnam War, courts typically refused to excuse the perpetrators of illegal protests from punishment on the basis of their challenging the legality of the Vietnam War; the courts ruled it was a political question. The necessity defense has sometimes been used as a shadow defense by civil disobedients to deny guilt without denouncing their politically motivated acts, and to present their political beliefs in the courtroom. However, court cases such as U.S. v. Schoon have greatly curtailed the availability of the political necessity defense. Likewise, when Carter Wentworth was charged for his role in the Clamshell Alliance's 1977 illegal occupation of the Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant, the judge instructed the jury to disregard his competing harms defense, and he was found guilty. Fully Informed Jury Association activists have sometimes handed out educational leaflets inside courthouses despite admonitions not to; according to FIJA, many of them have escaped prosecution because \"prosecutors have reasoned (correctly) that if they arrest fully informed jury leafleters, the leaflets will have to be given to the leafleter's own jury as evidence.\""}

In some groups, such as the flat, bottom-dwelling platyctenids, the juveniles behave more like true larvae, as they live among the plankton and thus occupy a different ecological niche from their parents and attain the adult form by a more radical metamorphosis, after dropping to the sea-floor."}

{"question": "What types of troops will be deployed?", "answers": ["30,000 additional"], "context": "West Point, New York (CNN) -- President Obama said Tuesday that the deployment of 30,000 additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan is part of a strategy to reverse the Taliban's momentum and stabilize the country's government.\n\n\n\n\"There is no imminent threat of the government being overthrown, but the Taliban has gained momentum,\" Obama said at the U.S. Military Academy. \"Al Qaeda has not re-emerged in Afghanistan in the same numbers as before 9/11, but they retain their safe-havens along the border.\n\n\n\n\"And our forces lack the full support they need to effectively train and partner with Afghan security forces and better secure the population. ... In short, the status quo is not sustainable.\"\n\n\n\nObama said he'd begin sending the additional troops \"at the fastest pace possible\" starting in early 2010 \"with a goal of starting to withdraw forces from the country in July 2011.\"\n\n\n\nThe president said additional U.S. forces bolstered by NATO troops \"will allow us to accelerate handing over responsibility to Afghan forces.\"\n\n\n\nSenior administration officials said Tuesday that Obama has a goal of withdrawing most U.S. forces by the end of his current term, which ends in January 2013.\n\n\n\nWatch what the new troops will do in Afghanistan\n\n\n\nIt will be the second increase of U.S. forces in the war-torn Islamic country ordered by Obama since he took office in January.\n\n\n\nIn his speech Tuesday, Obama said his strategy had three objectives:\n\n\n\n• Deny al Qaeda a safe haven\n\n\n\n• Reverse the Taliban's momentum and deny it the ability to overthrow Afghanistan's government\n\n\n\n• Strengthen Afghanistan's security forces and government\n\n\n\nThe additional troops was one way to achieve these, he said. Other strategies will include holding Afghan government leaders accountable for corruption, focus assistance on areas that could help the lives of Afghans, and securing the country's border with Pakistan.\n\n\n\n\"We are in Afghanistan to prevent a cancer from once again spreading through that country. But this same cancer has also taken root in the border region of Pakistan. That is why we need a strategy that works on both sides of the border,\" Obama said.\n\n\n\nThe president said he rejected the option of committing more forces for an undefined mission of nation-building without any deadlines.\n\n\n\n\"I reject this course because it sets goals that are beyond what we can achieve at a reasonable cost, and what we need to achieve to secure our interests,\" Obama said. \"Furthermore, the absence of a timeframe for transition would deny us any sense of urgency in working with the Afghan government. It must be clear that Afghans will have to take responsibility for their security, and that America has no interest in fighting an endless war in Afghanistan.\"\n\n\n\nObama rejected analogies with the war in Vietnam that divided America in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n\n\n\"Unlike Vietnam, we are joined by a broad coalition of 43 nations that recognizes the legitimacy of our action,\" Obama said. \"Unlike Vietnam, we are not facing a broad-based popular insurgency. And most importantly, unlike Vietnam, the American people were viciously attacked from Afghanistan, and remain a target for those same extremists who are plotting along its border.\"\n\n\n\nObama said the U.S. has no interest in occupying Afghanistan.\n\n\n\n\"We will support efforts by the Afghan government to open the door to those Taliban who abandon violence and respect the human rights of their fellow citizens,\" Obama said. \"And we will seek a partnership with Afghanistan grounded in mutual respect -- to isolate those who destroy; to strengthen those who build; to hasten the day when our troops will leave; and to forge a lasting friendship in which America is your partner, and never your patron.\"\n\n\n\nObama spoke to an audience of West Point cadets, staff and guests in outlining his strategy that he has deliberated for months, meeting several times with his national security team.\n\n\n\nHe recognized that some in the audience had fought in Afghanistan, and some would be deployed in the future.\n\n\n\n\"As your commander in chief, I owe you a mission that is clearly defined, and worthy of"}

{"question": "What are a third leading cause of death?", "answers": ["suicides"], "context": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- An increase in the number of suicides among military personnel can be traced, in part, to a \"stressed and tired force\" made vulnerable by multiple deployments, a military leader said Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nLong troop deployments in Iraq, above, and Afghanistan have been cited in the rise in military suicides.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We must find ways to relieve some of this stress,\" said Gen. Peter W. Chiarelli, vice chief of staff of the Army, in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Military Personnel Subcommittee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think it is the cumulative effect of deployments from 12 to 15 months,\" he said, adding that the longer deployments are scheduled to continue until June.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe cited long deployments, lengthy separations from family and the perceived stigma associated with seeking help as factors contributing to the suicides.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdm. Patrick M. Walsh, vice chief of naval operations, said suicides are the third leading cause of death in the Navy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We must eliminate the perceived stigma, shame and dishonor of asking for help,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nGen. James F. Amos, assistant commandant of the Marine Corps, said his branch of the service has incorporated education and training about suicide prevention \"at all levels.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said four of 55 mental health professionals deployed in the U.S. Central Command were recently embedded with Marines. He expressed optimism that that tactic would pay off, but he said he had no data to support his expectation.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd Gen. William M. Fraser, vice chief of staff of the Air Force, said his branch, too, was taking steps \"to ensure airmen are as mentally prepared for deployment and redeployment as they are physically and professionally.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said the efforts have not sufficed. He noted that last year, for the first time, the suicide rate among military personnel has exceeded that of the civilian population. \"What's going on?\" he asked rhetorically.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe panel members made clear that, whatever is going on, it is complex. Chiarelli said the Army tallied 133 confirmed suicides last year and is still investigating another seven possible ones. At least 70 percent of the suicides had \"some kind of relationship problem,\" he said. Often, the situation was worsened by something else, such as a financial or legal problem, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd it wasn't just the trauma of war that appears to heighten the risk. The suicides were about evenly divided among those who had returned from deployment, those who were still deployed -- some on a third or fourth tour -- and those who had never been deployed, Chiarelli said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll of the military leaders said they had too few mental health professionals in their ranks.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Walsh said professionals are not the only people who must be trained to intervene, noting that it is often the shipmate or the battle buddy who seeks assistance for someone in need.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd Navy counselors are now asking family members for feedback that often proves more illuminating than what the sailors themselves are willing to impart, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If I survey the family, I'm going to get a different set of answers.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOne reason some service personnel are reluctant to seek help from their chain of command is because they fear they will then be passed over for promotions, the panel members said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn some cases, they pay out of their own pockets to seek help privately, Rubenstein said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd others call civilian hotlines, one of which reported getting three calls per day this year from active-duty military personnel.\n\n\n\n\n\nRepresentatives of all of the branches of the military said they have seen recent increases in suicides.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the Pentagon, Defense Secretary William Gates said he believes the 15-month deployments \"were a real strain\" on many, but expressed optimism that beneficial changes are in the works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"All the services are are addressing this problem, but the Army in particular, I think, is really going after it in a very aggressive way,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut some suicides appear to defy all prevention efforts. Maj. Gen. David A. Rubenstein"}

{"question": "What did Ralph Lauren originally do?", "answers": ["tie salesman"], "context": "(InStyle) -- It all boils down to this. It doesn't really matter all that much what hot, nubile French maverick has set the fashion world on fire. Or which Milanese visionary has a new fabric technique discovered during a life-changing trip to Angkor Wat that's sure to bring back sixties minimalism with a twist. Or that so-and-so has signed a deal to develop boutique spa hotels around the globe in former monasteries. Because, in the end, he's Ralph Lauren, and we're not.\n\nRalph Lauren has his eye on China and Japan.\n\nFor four decades no other designer has had a greater impact, not only on the way American men and women dress but also on the way they imagine, seek and indulge in the Good Life, than the former tie salesman from the Bronx.\n\n\"Those ties were handmade, by the way,\" recalls Lauren. \"Back then, ties, even designer ones, didn't sell for more than $5 apiece. Mine were $12 to $15. Such luxury in something so simple was revolutionary.\"\n\nAnd ironic. Because while no other designer logo exemplifies aspiration in the home of the free and the brave like the mallet-wielding guy on the pony, Lauren originally named his company Polo because \"it was the sport of kings. It was glamorous, sexy and international.\"  See his designs »\n\nIn the beginning a few people questioned if it was named after Marco Polo -- but today the fact that virtually none of Lauren's millions of devoted customers has ever even seen a polo match is immaterial. Lauren instinctively caught something that was in the air before any of his competitors had a chance to grab it -- the desire, not just to be a success but to look like one before you'd even achieved your goal.\n\nWhat's more, Lauren made it look as easy as Fred Astaire dancing down a staircase.\n\n\"What matters the most to me are clothes that are consistent and accessible,\" says the designer.\n\n\"When I look at the people I've admired over the years, the ultimate stars, like Frank Sinatra, Cary Grant and Astaire, the ones who last the longest are the ones whose style has a consistency, whose naturalness is part of their excitement. And when you think of the blur of all the brands that are out there, the ones you believe in and the ones you remember, like Chanel and Armani, are the ones that stand for something. Fashion is about establishing an image that consumers can adapt to their own individuality. And it's an image that can change, that can evolve. It doesn't reinvent itself every two years.\"\n\nHowever, with a media that is insatiable for the new, the now and the next, being steadfast doesn't always make for good copy.\n\n\"The spotlight is always going to search for the newcomer,\" Lauren admits. \"And that's fine.

{"question": "Where was the shooting?", "answers": ["Westroads Mall in Omaha, Nebraska,"], "context": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Some experts are skeptical that anything could have stopped Robert Hawkins from going on a murderous rampage at an Omaha, Nebraska, shopping mall on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nA police car sits outside the Westroads Mall in Omaha, Nebraska, on Thursday.\n\n\n\n\"This is not something that anybody can reasonably anticipate,\" said Don Greene, a former FBI agent who has written a book on mall security.\n\n\n\n\"If the people closest to him didn't see any indicators or signs that he was going to go off so drastically ... how is some public safety officer supposed to recognize this person?\" Greene asked.\n\n\n\nIn fact, security at Omaha's Westroads Mall did find Hawkins' behavior suspicious before the shooting, Omaha Police Chief Thomas Warren said Thursday.\n\n\n\nMall surveillance initially flagged Hawkins \"based on his actions\" when he entered the mall through the Von Maur store's main entrance on the second floor, Warren said. He said Hawkins exited quickly after entering, then re-entered within six minutes and appeared to be concealing something in a balled-up sweatshirt.\n\n\n\nHe then went up the elevator to the third floor, and when he got there, he immediately began firing, Warren said.  \"It doesn't appear as though there was an opportunity for intervention,\" he said.\n\n\n\nShopping malls around the country were expected to review their emergency plans and consider additional security measures in light of Wednesday's shooting, which killed eight.  Watch what experts say about keeping malls safe »\n\n\n\n\"There is always a fear of copycats when something like this happens,\" said Malachy Kavanaugh, spokesman for the International Council of Shopping Centers. He said malls would be considering whether to close some entrances, bring in additional officers, and make security more visible.\n\n\n\nThere are 1,200 enclosed malls in the United States and about 50,000 shopping centers. Although some include police substations, most are patrolled by unarmed private mall and store security guards.\n\n\n\nShould these private security guards be armed? \"Absolutely not,\" said Greene. Greene said if a security officer were to pull a gun on an armed individual in a mall, it could result in \"the gunfight at the 'OK corral,' and then we might have 23 people killed instead of eight.\"\n\n\n\n\"These random events are very challenging to prevent and difficult to deal with when they occur. Law enforcement and security prevention measures, no matter how good, cannot forestall a tragedy such as this from happening,\" said a statement issued Wednesday night by the Simon Property Group, which operates regional and outlet malls across the United States.\n\n\n\n\"We do not disclose or discuss our enhanced security measures and/or procedures that we have in place or may institute at any given time, some of which are visible to the public, with others intentionally less noticeable,\" the statement said. \"Disclosure of such information could potentially compromise our efforts to provide a safe and secure environment.\"\n\n\n\nSecurity expert Lou Palumbo told CNN one useful strategy was having trained law enforcement personnel watching people as they enter the mall.\n\n\n\n\"You start to observe the people coming into the mall area,\" he said. \"To let them in your door and then try to figure out what they're doing, you know, it's not as effective as catching them as they're coming in the door.\"\n\n\n\nThe International Council of Shopping Centers has conducted focus groups with shoppers to test how they would react to even tighter \"airport style\" security measures, including bag checks and magnetometers.\n\n\n\nAccording to Kavanaugh, the results have shown that shoppers would accept the measures only if the national threat advisory system was raised to its highest level, red. Such extreme measures are \"in the mall industry playbook ... but it is something no one wants to do,\" said Kavanaugh.\n\n\n\nWhile some mall owners have increased training of security personnel and have upgraded their emergency systems, many security experts believe more should and can be done. Those experts suggest it's a matter of money. They say until shoppers start staying away, mall owners will not make significant changes"}

{"question": "A molecular phylogeny analysis confirmed that cydippid are not what?", "answers": ["monophyletic", "monophyletic", "monophyletic"], "context": "Since all modern ctenophores except the beroids have cydippid-like larvae, it has widely been assumed that their last common ancestor also resembled cydippids, having an egg-shaped body and a pair of retractable tentacles. Richard Harbison's purely morphological analysis in 1985 concluded that the cydippids are not monophyletic, in other words do not contain all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor that was itself a cydippid. Instead he found that various cydippid families were more similar to members of other ctenophore orders than to other cydippids. He also suggested that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was either cydippid-like or beroid-like. A molecular phylogeny analysis in 2001, using 26 species, including 4 recently discovered ones, confirmed that the cydippids are not monophyletic and concluded that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was cydippid-like. It also found that the genetic differences between these species were very small – so small that the relationships between the Lobata, Cestida and Thalassocalycida remained uncertain. This suggests that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was relatively recent, and perhaps was lucky enough to survive the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 65.5 million years ago while other lineages perished. When the analysis was broadened to include representatives of other phyla, it concluded that cnidarians are probably more closely related to bilaterians than either group is to ctenophores but that this diagnosis is uncertain."}

The commander of the Jin dynasty army made a tactical mistake in not attacking the Mongols at the first opportunity. Instead, the Jin commander sent a messenger, Ming-Tan, to the Mongol side, who defected and told the Mongols that the Jin army was waiting on the other side of the pass. At this engagement fought at Badger Pass the Mongols massacred hundreds of thousands of Jin troops. In 1215 Genghis besieged, captured, and sacked the Jin capital of Zhongdu (modern-day Beijing). This forced the Emperor Xuanzong to move his capital south to Kaifeng, abandoning the northern half of his kingdom to the Mongols.

That's right folks, if you mispronounce Arkansas (Ar-kan-saw) you're in for a fine or jail time. \n Is this true? Is it mentioned in Arkansas State Laws? \n As a subnote, Wikipedia mentions the below: \n In 1881, the pronunciation of Arkansas with the final \"s\" being silent was made official by an act of the state legislature after a dispute arose between Arkansas's then-two U.S. senators as one favored the pronunciation as /ˈɑrkənsɔː/ AR-kən-saw while the other favored /ɑrˈkænzəs/ ar-KAN-zəs. \n 2 \n   \n Even if such a law were on the books, it would likely be held unconstitutional and thus technically, not a law in the U.S. –  RBarryYoung Oct 23 '14 at 15:10 \n    \n   \n Agreed, that would be a clear 1st amendment violation. –  Andrew Medico Oct 23 '14 at 15:34 \n 2 \n   \n Cf.: Just because \"New York City\" is the official name, you won't get arrested for calling it \"The Big Apple\". –  Hagen von Eitzen Oct 23 '14 at 18:19 \n 3 \n   \n Your question rhymes!

Preventing speech in the first place (i.e. as opposed to the question of what legal consequences are allowed) is just a narrow subset of First Amendment law, not the whole thing; there's probably more that's been written about whether a vague law causes self-censorship to avoid violating it than about prior restraint of speech. –  cpast Oct 25 '14 at 5:07 \n The name, Arkansas, is a French pronunciation of a Siouxan word meaning \"land of downriver people\". It is pronounced: \n /ˈɑrkənsɔː/ \n In 1881, the Arkansas General Assembly passed Concurrent Resolution No. 4. \n The resolution was further modified in 1947 as Arkansas Code 1 April 105, and reads thusly: \n Whereas,   confusion of practice has arisen in the pronunciation of the name of   our state and it is deemed important that the true pronunciation   should be determined for use in oral official proceedings. And,   whereas, the matter has been thoroughly investigated by the State   Historical Society and the Eclectic Society of Little Rock, which have   agreed upon the correct pronunciation as derived from history, and the   early usage of the American immigrants. Be it therefore resolved by   both houses of the General Assembly, that the only true pronunciation   of the name of the state, in the opinion of this body, is that   received by the French from the native Indians and committed to   writing in the French word representing the sound. It should be   pronounced in three (3) syllables, with the final \"s\" silent, the \"a\"   in each syllable with the Italian sound, and the accent on the first   and last syllables. The pronunciation with the accent on the second   syllable with the sound of \"a\" in \"man\" and the sounding of the   terminal \"s\" is discouraged by Arkansans. \n The full explanation of the debate leading up to this resolution can be read here . \n Essentially, this resolution was just to make the proper pronunciation \"official\".

Will Eisner Week Will Eisner Week 2013 \n The German Revolution began on 29th October 1918, when sailors at Kiel refused to obey orders and engage in battle with the British Navy. The sailors in the German Navy mutinied and set up councils based on the soviets in Russia. By 6th November the revolution had spread to the Western Front and all major cities and ports in Germany.On 7th November, 1918, Kurt Eisner, leader of the Independent Socialist Party, declared Bavaria a Socialist Republic. Eisner made it clear that this revolution was different from the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia and announced that all private property would be protected by the new government.On 9th November, 1918, Kaiser Wilhelm II abdicated and the Chancellor, Max von Baden, handed power over to Friedrich Ebert, the leader of the German Social Democrat Party.In Bavaia Kurt Eisner formed a coalition with the German Social Democrat Party in the National Assembly. Eisner's rule was short-lived as he was assassinated by Anton Graf Arco, a fanatical nationalist, on 21st February, 1919. \n Fearing a counter-revolution, supporters of Eisner established Soldiers' and Workers' Councils and took over the government from the National Assembly. Eugen Levine, a member of the German Communist Party (KPD), became the new leader of the Bavarian Republic.Inspired by the events of the October Revolution, Levine ordered the expropriated of luxury flats and gave them to the homeless. Factories were to be run by joint councils of workers and owners and workers' control of industry and plans were made to abolish paper money. Levine, like the Bolsheviks had done in Russia, established Red Guard units to defend the revolution.In January, 1919, the Spartakist Rising, led by Rosa Luxemburg, Leo Jogiches, Clara Zetkin and Karl Liebknecht took place in Berlin.Friedrich Ebert now saw his own power under threat and called in the German Army and the Freikorps to bring an end to the rebellion. By 13th January the rebellion had been crushed and its leaders, including Rosa Luxemburg, Karl Liebknecht and Leo Jogiches had been captured and executed.With Freikorps units massing on Bavaria's northern borders, the Red Guards began arresting people they considered to be hostile to the new regime. On 29th April, 1919, eight men were executed after being found guilty of being right-wing spies.Friedrich Ebert, the Chancellor of Germany, now ordered the German Army and the Freikorps into Bavaria. They quickly gained control and over the next few weeks an estimate 700 men and women were captured and executed. Eugen Levine was arrested and after being found guilty of being involved in the execution of the eight spies, was shot by a firing squad. \n Does anyone know the correct trivia answers for Chicago’s US 99.5 for June 16, 2008? \n What are the correct Listen & Win as well as the correct trivia answers for US 99.f for Monday June 16,2008? \n Champions Chris Weinke is the quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers and played his college football at Florida State where he won little trophy called the Heisman.

{"question": "In what way do idea strings transmit tesion forces?", "answers": ["action-reaction pairs", "instantaneously in action-reaction pairs", "in action-reaction pairs", "instantaneously in action-reaction pairs"], "context": "Tension forces can be modeled using ideal strings that are massless, frictionless, unbreakable, and unstretchable. They can be combined with ideal pulleys, which allow ideal strings to switch physical direction. Ideal strings transmit tension forces instantaneously in action-reaction pairs so that if two objects are connected by an ideal string, any force directed along the string by the first object is accompanied by a force directed along the string in the opposite direction by the second object. By connecting the same string multiple times to the same object through the use of a set-up that uses movable pulleys, the tension force on a load can be multiplied. For every string that acts on a load, another factor of the tension force in the string acts on the load. However, even though such machines allow for an increase in force, there is a corresponding increase in the length of string that must be displaced in order to move the load.

He said he underestimated the amount of children who would participate, and the club's capacity to take on the groups was not up to the task.\n\n\n\n\"It was a safety issue,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThe Creative Steps Day Care children -- who are in kindergarten through seventh grade -- went to The Valley Swim Club in Huntingdon Valley on June 29 after the center's director, Alethea Wright, had contracted to use the club once a week.\n\n\n\nDuring their first visit, some children said they heard club members asking why African-American children were there. One youngster told a Philadelphia television station a woman there said she feared the children \"might do something\" to her child.  Watch Wright react to comments allegedly aimed at the children »\n\n\n\nDays later, the day care center's $1,950 check was returned without explanation, Wright said.\n\n\n\nShe was dismissive of Duesler's comments Friday.\n\n\n\n\"He knows what happened at the pool that day,\" Wright told CNN in a telephone interview. \"I was embarrassed and humiliated.\"\n\n\n\nShe called it an \"unfortunate situation,\" adding, \"I know what happened; the members know what happened and a higher power knows what happened.\"  Watch the club president say racism is not at play »\n\n\n\nAfter news reports of the incident, the office of Sen. Arlen Specter (D-Pennsylvania) said Specter sent a letter to the club president asking him to reinstate the contract with Creative Steps, saying, \"I think that you would agree that there is no place for racism in America today.\"\n\n\n\nDuesler said he appreciates the senator's concern, but the club's board has yet to make a decision of how it will proceed.\n\n\n\n\"If we're going to revise our policies here, we need to make it so for all the camps,\" he said. \"I just don't think we're prepared for that.\"\n\n\n\nDuesler earlier in the week told two Philadelphia television stations the children had changed \"the complexion\" and \"atmosphere\" of the club, a comment that protesters outside the facility Thursday said showed that racism was involved.\n\n\n\nBernice Duesler, John Duesler's wife, called the negative response her husband has faced since the incident \"unbearable.\"\n\n\n\n\"He's not one of the good guys -- he's one of the great guys,\" she said, holding back tears. \"He doesn't deserve this.\"\n\n\n\nShe added, \"If there really was a racial issue that happened, my husband and I would be the first one[s] picketing.\"\n\n\n\nJim Flynn, who said he was one of the club members who made a complaint against the children, told CNN this week it was not racially motivated.\n\n\n\n\"There were a lot of children in the pool and not enough lifeguards,\" he said. \"As general members we were not told that they were coming. If we knew, we could decide to not come when the pool was crowded or come anyway. We could have had an option.\"\n\n\n\nHe also said invitations to two other day care centers, neither of which contained minority children, had previously been withdrawn.\n\n\n\nGirard College, a private Philadelphia boarding school, told CNN on Thursday it would offer Creative Steps Day Care use of its facilities this summer."}
{"question": "Who succeeded Brezhnev as Soviet premier?", "answers": ["yuri andropov", "andropov"], "context": "Leonid BrezhnevLeonid Ilyich Brezhnev (;  ; , 19 December 1906 (O.S. 6 December) – 10 November 1982) was the General Secretary of the Central Committee (CC) of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), presiding over the country from 1964 until his death in 1982. His eighteen-year term as General Secretary was second only to that of Joseph Stalin in duration. During Brezhnev's rule, the global influence of the Soviet Union grew dramatically, in part because of the expansion of the Soviet military during this time. His tenure as leader was marked by the beginning of an era of economic and social stagnation in the Soviet Union. \n Brezhnev was born in Kamianske into a Russian worker's family. After graduating from the Dniprodzerzhynsk Metallurgical Technicum, he became a metallurgical engineer in the iron and steel industry, in Ukraine. He joined Komsomol in 1923, and in 1929 became an active member of the CPSU. He was drafted into immediate military service during World War II and left the army in 1946 with the rank of major general. In 1952 Brezhnev became a member of the Central Committee, and during 1964, Brezhnev succeeded Nikita Khrushchev as First Secretary, while Alexei Kosygin succeeded Khrushchev in his post as Soviet premier. \n As a leader, Brezhnev took care to consult his colleagues before acting, but his attempt to govern without meaningful economic reforms led to a national decline by the mid-1970s, a period referred to as the Era of Stagnation. A significant increase in military expenditure, which by the time of Brezhnev's death stood at approximately 12.5% of the country's GNP, and an aging and ineffective leadership set the stage for a dwindling GNP compared to Western nations. While at the helm of the USSR, Brezhnev pushed for détente between the Eastern and Western countries. At the same time he presided over the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia to stop the Prague Spring, and he sent the Soviet military to Afghanistan in an attempt to save the fragile regime, which was fighting a war against the mujahideen. However, in December 1981 he decided not to militarily intervene in Poland, instead allowing the country's government to impose martial law, and effectively marking the end of the Brezhnev Doctrine. \n After years of declining health, Brezhnev died on 10 November 1982 and was quickly succeeded in his post as General Secretary by Yuri Andropov. Brezhnev had fostered a cult of personality, although not nearly to the same degree as Stalin. Mikhail Gorbachev, who would lead the USSR from 1985 to 1991, denounced his legacy and drove the process of liberalisation of the Soviet Union. In spite of this, opinion polls in Russia show Brezhnev to be the most popular Russian leader of the 20th century. \n Early life and career \n Origins and education \n Brezhnev was born on 19 December 1906 in Kamianske in Ukraine), to metalworker Ilya Yakovlevich Brezhnev and his wife, Natalia Denisovna Mazalova. His parents used to live in Brezhnevo (Kursky District, Kursk Oblast, Russia) before moving to Kamenskoe. Brezhnev's ethnicity was specified as Ukrainian in some documents,   including his passport,  and Russian in others.  Like many youths in the years after the Russian Revolution of 1917, he received a technical education, at first in land management where he started as a land surveyor and then in metallurgy. He graduated from the Dniprodzerzhynsk Metallurgical Technicum in 1935 and became a metallurgical engineer in the iron and steel industries of eastern Ukraine. \n Political development \n Brezhnev joined the Communist Party youth organisation, the Komsomol, in 1923, and the Party itself in 1929. In 1935 and 1936, Brezhnev served his compulsory military service, and after taking courses at a tank school, he served as a political commissar in a tank factory. Later in 1936, he became director of the Dniprodzerzhynsk Metallurgical Technicum (technical college). In 1936, he was transferred to the regional center of Dnipropetrovsk and, in 1939, he became Party Secretary in Dnipropetrovsk, in charge of the city's important defence industries. As a survivor of Stalin's Great Purge of 1937–39, he was able to advance quickly as the purges created numerous openings in the senior and middle ranks of"}

{"question": "What type of company is Van Gend en Loos?", "answers": ["a postal company", "a postal company", "a postal company"], "context": "Although it is generally accepted that EU law has primacy, not all EU laws give citizens standing to bring claims: that is, not all EU laws have \"direct effect\". In Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen it was held that the provisions of the Treaties (and EU Regulations) are directly effective, if they are (1) clear and unambiguous (2) unconditional, and (3) did not require EU or national authorities to take further action to implement them. Van Gend en Loos, a postal company, claimed that what is now TFEU article 30 prevented the Dutch Customs Authorities charging tariffs, when it imported urea-formaldehyde plastics from Germany to the Netherlands. After a Dutch court made a reference, the Court of Justice held that even though the Treaties did not \"expressly\" confer a right on citizens or companies to bring claims, they could do so. Historically, international treaties had only allowed states to have legal claims for their enforcement, but the Court of Justice proclaimed \"the Community constitutes a new legal order of international law\". Because article 30 clearly, unconditionally and immediately stated that no quantitative restrictions could be placed on trade, without a good justification, Van Gend en Loos could recover the money it paid for the tariff. EU Regulations are the same as Treaty provisions in this sense, because as TFEU article 288 states, they are ‘directly applicable in all Member States’. Moreover, member states comes under a duty not to replicate Regulations in their own law, in order to prevent confusion. For instance, in Commission v Italy the Court of Justice held that Italy had breached a duty under the Treaties, both by failing to operate a scheme to pay farmers a premium to slaughter cows (to reduce dairy overproduction), and by reproducing the rules in a decree with various additions. \"Regulations,\" held the Court of Justice, \"come into force solely by virtue of their publication\" and implementation could have the effect of \"jeopardizing their simultaneous and uniform application in the whole of the Union.\" On the other hand, some Regulations may themselves expressly require implementing measures, in which case those specific rules should be followed."}

Apollo 4 (AS-501) was the first unmanned flight of the Saturn V, carrying a Block I CSM on November 9, 1967. The capability of the Command Module's heat shield to survive a trans-lunar reentry was demonstrated by using the Service Module engine to ram it into the atmosphere at higher than the usual Earth-orbital reentry speed. This was followed on April 4, 1968, by Apollo 6 (AS-502) which carried a CSM and a LM Test Article as ballast. The intent of this mission was to achieve trans-lunar injection, followed closely by a simulated direct-return abort, using the Service Module engine to achieve another high-speed reentry. The Saturn V experienced pogo oscillation, a problem caused by non-steady engine combustion, which damaged fuel lines in the second and third stages. Two S-II engines shut down prematurely, but the remaining engines were able to compensate. The damage to the third stage engine was more severe, preventing it from restarting for trans-lunar injection. Mission controllers were able to use the Service Module engine to essentially repeat the flight profile of Apollo 4. Based on the good performance of Apollo 6 and identification of satisfactory fixes to the Apollo 6 problems, NASA declared the Saturn V ready to fly men, cancelling a third unmanned test."}

{"question": "What was Tesla's AC system used for in Pittsburgh?", "answers": ["to power the city's streetcars.", "the city's streetcars", "street cars"], "context": "During that year, Tesla worked in Pittsburgh, helping to create an alternating current system to power the city's streetcars. He found the time there frustrating because of conflicts between him and the other Westinghouse engineers over how best to implement AC power. Between them, they settled on a 60-cycle AC current system Tesla proposed (to match the working frequency of Tesla's motor), although they soon found that, since Tesla's induction motor could only run at a constant speed, it would not work for street cars. They ended up using a DC traction motor instead."}
{"question": "What type of city has Warsaw been for as long as it's been a city?", "answers": ["multi-cultural", "multi-cultural city", "multi-cultural"], "context": "Throughout its existence, Warsaw has been a multi-cultural city. According to the 1901 census, out of 711,988 inhabitants 56.2% were Catholics, 35.7% Jews, 5% Greek orthodox Christians and 2.8% Protestants. Eight years later, in 1909, there were 281,754 Jews (36.9%), 18,189 Protestants (2.4%) and 2,818 Mariavites (0.4%). This led to construction of hundreds of places of religious worship in all parts of the town. Most of them were destroyed in the aftermath of the Warsaw Uprising of 1944. After the war, the new communist authorities of Poland discouraged church construction and only a small number were rebuilt."}
{"question": "What did Luther call his stay a Wartburg Castle?", "answers": ["my Patmos", "my Patmos", "my Patmos"], "context": "Luther's disappearance during his return trip back to Wittenberg was planned. Frederick III had him intercepted on his way home in the forest near Wittenberg by masked horsemen who were made to appear as armed highwaymen. They escorted Luther to the security of the Wartburg Castle at Eisenach. During his stay at Wartburg, which he referred to as \"my Patmos\", Luther translated the New Testament from Greek into German and poured out doctrinal and polemical writings. These included a renewed attack on Archbishop Albrecht of Mainz, whom he shamed into halting the sale of indulgences in his episcopates, and a \"Refutation of the Argument of Latomus,\" in which he expounded the principle of justification to Jacobus Latomus, an orthodox theologian from Louvain."}

{"question": "Where did Larry Zeiger  move?", "answers": ["Miami Beach, Florida,"], "context": "Editors' Note: Below is an excerpt from Larry King's new autobiography \"My Remarkable Journey\" published by Weinstein Books. Larry King anchors \"Larry King Live at 9 p.m. ET on CNN.\n\n\n\nIn 1959, Bobby Darin, left, was Larry's first major guest on his WKAT radio program.\n\n\n\nLarry Zeiger left Brooklyn, New York, for Miami Beach, Florida, at the age of 23 to try to find a job in radio. This is how he got his new name:\n\n\n\nI went to stay with my Uncle Jack in Miami Beach.\n\n\n\nI was so excited that I started knocking on doors the next day.\n\n\n\nI stopped at a small station on First Street, WAHR. The guy in charge liked my voice. \"We get a lot of people coming and going,\" he told me. \"If you hang around, you'll get the first opening.\"\n\n\n\nI sat and watched in fascination for a few weeks. It was a tiny operation, but the sight of the UPI and AP machines furiously clicking out news made me feel like I was on the brink of something big. Miami Beach was like a dream. The palm trees. The ocean. I remember walking past Joe's Stone Crab. Joe's is more than a restaurant, it's a landmark.\n\n\n\nIt was full when I arrived in 1957, and I guarantee you, people will be waiting in line tomorrow night. I stopped outside the front window with only a few dollars in my pocket, unable to afford a meal, looking at the happy faces, wondering what it would take to get into a place like that.\n\n\n\nThen came my big break. There was a morning deejay named Tom Baer. He was making sixty dollars a week and his alimony was sixty-five. He claimed to be living off the coconuts falling from trees. He quit on a Friday, and the general manager told me I could start on Monday.\n\n\n\nI must have rehearsed the entire weekend. I don't even think I slept. On Monday morning I showed up at WAHR with the record that would play my theme song, \"Swingin' Down the Lane.\"\n\n\n\nThe general manager called me into his office to wish me good luck. \"By the way,\" he said, \"what name are you going to use?\"\n\n\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\n\n\"You can't use Larry Zeiger,\" he said. \"It's too ethnic. People won't be able to spell it or remember it. You need a better name.\"\n\n\n\nThere was no time to think about whether this was good or bad or what my mother would say. I was going on the air in five minutes. The Miami Herald was spread out on his desk. Face-up was a full-page ad for King's Wholesale Liquors. The general manager looked down and said, \"King! How about Larry King?\"\n\n\n\n\"OK,\" I said. This was the opportunity of a lifetime. I wasn't going to blow it.\n\n\n\n\"Fine. You'll host The Larry King Show.\"\n\n\n\nNine o'clock was approaching. That's when the news came on. A few minutes later, The Larry King Show would make its debut. I went through the control-room door, sat down, and set up my record. The news ended. I started my theme song, then faded down the music so I could introduce myself. I opened my mouth. It was as dry as cotton. For the first time in my life, I couldn't speak.\n\n\n\nSo I brought \"Swingin' Down the Lane\" up again and faded it once more. Again, not a single word came out of my mouth.\n\n\n\nI could only wonder if listeners were hearing the pounding of my heart. I'd waited for this moment my whole life. How could I be blowing it? Once more, I cranked up \"Swingin' Down the Lane\" -- but not a word came out of me.\n\n\n\nThe next thing I knew, the"}

Andreas Karlstadt, supported by the ex-Augustinian Gabriel Zwilling, embarked on a radical programme of reform there in June 1521, exceeding anything envisaged by Luther. The reforms provoked disturbances, including a revolt by the Augustinian friars against their prior, the smashing of statues and images in churches, and denunciations of the magistracy. After secretly visiting Wittenberg in early December 1521, Luther wrote A Sincere Admonition by Martin Luther to All Christians to Guard Against Insurrection and Rebellion. Wittenberg became even more volatile after Christmas when a band of visionary zealots, the so-called Zwickau prophets, arrived, preaching revolutionary doctrines such as the equality of man, adult baptism, and Christ's imminent return. When the town council asked Luther to return, he decided it was his duty to act."}

It had a vogue in Europe and the U.S. in the 1920s and for a time threatened to supplant bridge in popularity. \n Online Etymology Dictionary, © 2010 Douglas Harper  MajiangMajiang \n PLAY CASINO GAMES \n Majiang \n Majiang is a four-player game that originated in China. Majiang requires skill, intelligence, calculation and, like other gambling games, a certain amount of luck. \n Though rules differ depending on regional variations, the overall aim of the game is to amass a greater score than the other players. \n Generally, to get a higher score, a player must be able to call \"Majiang\" by building complete tile sets. The three basic sets are as follows: \n SET \n EXAMPLES \n Pong or Pung \n A set of 3 identical tiles (similar to a three of a kind in poker but without the kickers). \n ; \n . \n Kong \n A set of 4 identical tiles (similar to a four of a kind in poker but without the kickers). \n ; \n . \n Chow \n A run of 3 tiles in the same suit (similar to a straight in poker but with only three tiles). \n ; \n ; \n . \n The closest Western game to Majiang is perhaps the card game Gin Rummy. Both Majiang and Gin Rummy involve selecting or discarding tiles or cards to form groups or sets of similar suits. \n Majiang (Májiàng) or Máquè is Mandarin for the popular Chinese game of Mahjong ( \n ). In Cantonese ( \n ), the game is called màhjeung or màhjeuk. In English, the game is spelled as mahjongg, majong, Majiang, mah-jong, mah-jongg or just M-J. Joseph Park Babcock trademarked the spelling \"Mah-Jongg\" in 1920. \n The Chinese word \n literally means \"hemp general\". While the Cantonese alternate writing, \n , literally means \"sparrow\". In Japanese, \n means \"hemp sparrow\" and pronounced as mā-jan. \n FREE TABLE GAMES  Mah Jong - History and Useful InformationMah Jong - History and Useful Information \n Mah Jong - History and Useful Information \n Pre 1920 History    Post          1920 History    Rules    Links    Where to Buy \n Introduction \n A          great deal of bunkum has been written about the origin of Mah Jong.   Both the Chinese, and later, the rest of the world decided to embellish          the truth liberally and outrageously for nefarious purposes and the result          has been a number of spurious assertions for the game's history.  As usual with Chinese games, one theory has it that Confucious invented          it and mystical histories of hundreds and even thousands of years have          been claimed often by western tradesmen keen to impress their potential          customers.  All this is very unlikely because the stark truth is          that no evidence of the game exists before around 1880.  \n In fact, the history of the game is straightforward and          can be viewed in two parts - \"until the early 1920s\" when the          game was almost exclusively played by the Chinese and \"after the          early 1920s\" when the game was discovered and immediately popularised          by other nations.  \n A set of 144 Mah Jong tiles consists of 36 tiles in the          Bamboo suit, 36 in the Circle suit, 36 in the Character suit, 16 Wind          tiles, 12 Dragon tiles and 8 bonus tiles (4 Flowers and 4 Seasons).  The best tiles are made from bamboo and ivory or bone and have beautiful          hand-painted pictures representing the face of each tile.   Traditionally,          the Flowers, Seasons and the One of Bamboos come in for particular artistic          creativity.  \n The aim is to collect sets of tiles according to the number          and type shown"}

Junior ministers, who do not attend cabinet, are also appointed to assist Scottish ministers in their departments. Most ministers and their juniors are drawn from amongst the elected MSPs, with the exception of Scotland's Chief Law Officers: the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General.

But they soon got to know her as a hard-nosed, strong-willed girl, happy to debate friends, family or teachers.\n\n\n\n\"When she opened her mouth and she spoke, she really felt whatever it was,\" said Jeanette Valdespino-Torres, a childhood friend.\n\n\n\n\"And she wasn't just talking out of the top of her head -- it was something that she read, she studied, she looked, she knew. She would get into conversations at that age that I couldn't even touch.\"  Watch friends remember Sotomayor as a teenager »\n\n\n\nIn the lunchroom Sotomayor would \"hold court,\" various friends from her school years told CNN, sharing opinions on policies and social problems.\n\n\n\nShe even led discussions around her home, an apartment in the sprawling 28-building Bronxdale Housing project that was so rife with drugs and crime that police often locked it down on Saturday nights, Sotomayor said in one speech.\n\n\n\nIf she is confirmed by the full Senate Sotomayor, now 55, would be the first Latina Supreme Court justice. President Obama has spoken of her \"inspiring life's journey.\"\n\n\n\nSotomayor's 1972 graduating class knew they were a generation facing \"change,\" said Jeri Faulkner, who was a freshman when Sotomayor was a senior. It was a time when the Vietnam War and social and economic strife were in the news daily.\n\n\n\n\"There was a lot of change and turmoil, and they were very involved in it -- very, very involved in social issues; very, very ready to change the world,\" Faulkner, now Cardinal Spellman's Dean of Students, said of Sotomayor's class. \"And Sonia, she was at the forefront of those discussions.\"\n\n\n\nA fixture on the debate team and in student government, Sotomayor was even a part of change inside Cardinal Spellman -- helping to write a unified constitution when male and female classes merged in 1971.\n\n\n\nOutside school, Sotomayor spent some vacations working at the United Bargains store in the Bronx, though she has admitted she was too young for a job. She also worked.with her mother at Prospect Hospital.  See photos of Sotomayor throughout her life »\n\n\n\nHard work was a fixture of the Sotomayor household. Juan Sotomayor, Sonia's father, died when she was 9, leaving her mother, Celina, to fend for Sonia and her younger brother, also named Juan.\n\n\n\nCelina Sotomayor started at the hospital as a telephone operator and later became a registered nurse. She worked long hours to earn enough to send her children to better schools like Cardinal Spellman, which now boasts of its graduate with a banner on its pale brick facade. And she used spare money to buy the neighborhood's only encyclopedia.\n\n\n\nSonia's mother was clear in what she expected from her daughter, said Valdespino-Torres. When she got home from work and stepped into the brick building, she always asked Sonia if she had done her homework, food shopping or laundry.\n\n\n\n\"Only then, Sonia would be allowed to go out,\" Valdespino-Torres said."}

Kenya invoked the U.N. charter allowing military action in self-defense against its largely lawless neighbor.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe abductions are part of a \"recent spate of blatant attacks\" that are part of \"a changed strategy by Al-Shabaab calculated to terrorize civilians,\" the communique said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you are attacked by an enemy, you have to pursue that enemy through hot pursuit and to try (to) hit wherever that enemy is,\" said Kenyan Defense Minister Yusuf Haji in a news conference that aired Sunday on CNN affiliate NTV.\n\n\n\n\n\nAl-Shabaab, which is linked to al Qaeda, has been fighting to impose its interpretation of Islamic law, or sharia, on Somalia. The group issued a statement Tuesday, however, denying responsibility for the abductions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These are mere suppositions unfounded in any solid evidence,\" the statement said. \"Kenyan authorities have been seeking justification for an aggressive incursion on to Somali territory.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOn September 11, armed bandits broke into a beachfront cottage where Britons Judith and David Tebbutt, both in their 50s, were staying. David Tebbutt was shot dead while trying to resist the attack.

The military said last week it had taken the remaining Al-Shabaab strongholds in the far northeast of the city.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The challenge is now to protect civilians from the sort of terror attack we saw last week, as they attempt to rebuild their lives,\" said Lt. Col. Paddy Ankunda, spokesman for the African Union Mission in Somalia. He was referring to a suicide truck bombing in Mogadishu this month that left dozens dead. Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility. Other Al-Shabaab attacks that week led to the deaths of at least 10 civilians.\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal and African Union forces have battled Al-Shabaab in the impoverished and chaotic nation for years. Many analysts believe the military push has severely affected Al-Shabaab, along with targeted strikes against organization members and the weakening of al Qaeda.\n\n\n\n\n\nAl-Shabaab said in August it was withdrawing from Mogadishu, and Somalia's Transitional Federal Government, backed by African Union peacekeepers, now controls most districts of the capital, the U.N. office has said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the group still poses a threat, Ankunda has said."}

{"question": "What will decrease dependence on foreign oil?", "answers": ["Cash for Clunkers"], "context": "Editor's note: Jack D. Hidary co-founded a technology company, Earth Web/Dice, and a financial research company, Vista Research. He works currently in the fields of clean energy technology and policy and is chairman of SmartTransportation.org which successfully pushed for the use of hybrid cars as taxis in New York City.\n\n\n\nJack Hidary says the Cash for Clunkers program promotes fuel economy and safety while boosting the economy.\n\n\n\nNEW YORK (CNN) -- Our country is facing a daunting economic challenge this year and we must take steps to pull ourselves out of this ditch.\n\n\n\nOne such program that has hit the ground running is Cash for Clunkers. It's helping consumers move beyond these hard times and has reignited a whole industry.\n\n\n\nCash for Clunkers is now working in more than 10 countries around the world. In Germany, consumers have junked more than 1.2 million guzzlers in the last five months and significantly boosted the economy there. So we know that Clunkers programs get the job done. How many other government programs can you say that about?\n\n\n\nThe Senate has joined the House in passing an additional $2 billion for Cash for Clunkers, allowing the program to move forward. This will bring additional buyers to the showroom. One key feature of the Clunkers program is that it is not just $3 billion of new money into the economy. It is injecting $21 billion -- since consumers must bring the rest of the money to pay for the new car. That is a lot of stimulus for the dollar.\n\n\n\nCash for Clunkers is saving jobs up and down the auto supply chain: from dealers to assembly workers and parts markers. Dealerships alone lost 50,000 jobs in the last 18 months and would continue to shed jobs without this program.\n\n\n\nIf you look at the new cars consumers are buying with the program, 45 percent are from Detroit's Big Three automakers. That is a lot of new sales for Ford, GM and Chrysler.\n\n\n\nCash for Clunkers also helps autoworkers across the country. Let's remember that lots of the Toyotas and Hondas sold in the program are made by American workers right here in this country. They are in states such as Kentucky, Tennessee and Alabama. This program helps all American autoworkers, not just those up North.\n\n\n\nSome people ask why we should help the auto industry and not other industries in this same way. Cash for Clunkers actually helps all of us -- even those of us who do not participate in the program or work in the auto industry.\n\n\n\nFirst, the auto industry has so many connected jobs in real estate, finance, manufacturing and other industries, that is hard to separate it out.\n\n\n\nSecond, one of the biggest drags on our economy is our trade imbalance. We import about $700 billion more than we export. That hurts our capital flows, credit and other key indicators.\n\n\n\nGuess what amounts to 50 percent of that trade imbalance? Oil. We use 21 million barrels of oil every day in the United States and import 62 percent of that -- mainly from countries that really don't like us. We use that oil mainly for transportation -- cars, SUVs, and other vehicles.\n\n\n\nUnless we scrap guzzlers at a faster rate, we will never reduce our oil consumption. Cash for Clunkers is a step in the right direction. It educates the consumer on how much they are paying for having a low-MPG car and encourages them to get into a more efficient vehicle.\n\n\n\nA family can save $750-$1,000 a year by jumping just 10 mpg in efficiency. Those savings will increase as gas prices go back up. Gas has already shot up from $1.50 a gallon to $2.60. Do you want to be stuck with a 10 mile-per-gallon guzzler when gas jumps back to $4 a gallon?\n\n\n\nThird, Cash for Clunkers saves lives. When you bring in a clunker that has no airbags, anti-lock brakes or other modern safety features and get a new car that does, you are protecting your family. Forty thousand people die every year on American highways and many more get serious injuries.\n\n\n\nYou can reduce"}

(film)Murder, Inc. is a 1960 American gangster film starring Stuart Whitman, May Britt, Henry Morgan, Peter Falk, and Simon Oakland. The Cinemascope movie was directed by Burt Balaban and Stuart Rosenberg. The screenplay was based on the true story of Murder, Inc., a Brooklyn gang that operated in the 1930s. \n Falk plays Abe Reles, a vicious thug who led the Murder, Inc. gang and was believed to have committed thirty murders, for which he was never prosecuted. The film was the first major feature role for Falk, who was nominated for a best supporting actor Academy Award for his performance. In his 2006 autobiography, Just One More Thing, Falk said that Murder, Inc. launched his career. \n The movie was the first film directed by Rosenberg, who later won acclaim for films that included Cool Hand Luke (1967), and also launched Stuart Whitman's career as a leading man. \n A more highly fictionalized film on the same basic events, The Enforcer (1951), starring Humphrey Bogart, was released in the United Kingdom with the title Murder, Inc. \n Plot summary \n Abe Reles (Peter Falk) and Bug Workman (Warren Finnerty), two killers from Brooklyn's Brownsville district, meet in the Garment District to meet with Louis \"Lepke\" Buchalter, kingpin of an organized crime mob, who hires them as the syndicate's hit men. \n Their first job is to kill Walter Sage (Morey Amsterdam), a Catskill resort owner who has been holding back slot machine profits from Lepke. To get close to Sage, Reles forces singer Joey Collins (Stuart Whitman), an old crony of Sage who owes Reles money, to help him. Reles and his henchman kill Sage. Reles visits Joey and threatens to kill him and his dancer wife Eadie (May Britt) if they tell anyone about the murder. Eadie throws Reles out. Reles later returns to the apartment when Joey is gone and brutally rapes her. Despite her urging Joey refuses to run away, and this causes him and Eadie to split up. \n Reles continues to carry out assassinations at Lepke's direction. Reles reconciles with the couple by giving them a luxurious apartment filled with stolen goods. Under police pressure, Lepke hides out from the police at Joey and Eadie's new apartment. He treats Eadie like a maid. \n District Attorney Burton Turkus (Henry Morgan) takes over the law enforcement campaign against Murder, Inc., enlisting local Brownsville police detective Tobin (Simon Oakland). Lepke orders the death of the entire Brownsville gang as well as Joey and Eadie. Eadie visits Turkus and becomes an informant, as does Joey. He then confronts Reles, who has been arrested, in his cell, and threatens to testify against him. In fear of that, Reles agrees to testify against Lepke in exchange for reduced charges. He provides a detailed account of the activities of Murder, Inc. \n Turkus puts Joey and Reles in protective custody and hides them at the Half Moon Hotel in Coney Island. Eadie comes to visit Joey, imploring him to testify against Lepke. Joey is reluctant, fearing the mob will kill Eadie in revenge. Despondent, Eadie slips her police escort and wanders alone on the beachfront, where she is murdered. Later that night, Reles is thrown out the window by an assassin. Joey avenges his wife's death by testifying against Lepke, who is executed. \n Cast \n * Stuart Whitman – Joey Collins \n * May Britt – Eadie Collins \n * Henry Morgan – Burton Turkus \n * Peter Falk – Abe 'Kid Twist' Reles \n * David J.

Geologically speaking, parts of its north-western edge still belong to Thrace , while to the east and south chalk and Paleozoic slate and limestone come together to form hills and mountains , peaking in the Uludag, the classical Bithnyian Olympus (2500m/8205ft). Verdant forests of beech, pine, fir, oak and rhododendron grow on Bithynia's well-watered Black Sea slopes and farming benefits from the sunshine higher up. More intensive farming in some parts is carried out by such settlers such as the Muhacir who were driven out of the Balkans, Caucasus, Crimea, etc. when the Ottoman Empire was stripped of these provinces in the late 19th c.

Settled originally by the Thracians , around 550 BC. it was taken by the Lydians then later by the Persians . Since the wooded mountains of the north remained outside the dominion of Alexander the Great and his successors, Bithynia under the Seleucids was able to develop more or less independently and by the 2nd century BC, had become a kingdom in its own right, flourishing around its ancient capitals of Nikomedeia (modern Izmit ) and Nicaea (modern Iznik). In 74 BC. it was made a Roman province. The Greek colony founded on the Bosphorus around 675 BC, where the Istanbul suburb of Kadikoy stands today, became the Romans ' capital and in the Byzantine era , when it was the seat of the archbishopric, provided the venue for the fourth ecumenical council in 451. In the 11th century Bithynia was ruled by the Seljuks .

During his first year, Tesla never missed a lecture, earned the highest grades possible, passed nine exams (nearly twice as many required), started a Serbian culture club, and even received a letter of commendation from the dean of the technical faculty to his father, which stated, \"Your son is a star of first rank.\" Tesla claimed that he worked from 3 a.m. to 11 p.m., no Sundays or holidays excepted. He was \"mortified when [his] father made light of [those] hard won honors.\" After his father's death in 1879, Tesla found a package of letters from his professors to his father, warning that unless he were removed from the school, Tesla would be killed through overwork. During his second year, Tesla came into conflict with Professor Poeschl over the Gramme dynamo, when Tesla suggested that commutators weren't necessary. At the end of his second year, Tesla lost his scholarship and became addicted to gambling. During his third year, Tesla gambled away his allowance and his tuition money, later gambling back his initial losses and returning the balance to his family.

Mandatory Credit: Jack Gruber-USA TODAY Sports \n Unlike the other three golf major championships that are played on different venues around the world, The Masters has been played at The Augusta National Golf Club since it’s inception. Augusta National is the one stop on the PGA tour that almost everyone who is familiar with the sport of golf has one hole, or one memory that is firmly implanted in their mind and represents The Masters. \n In 1930 during the depths of the great depression, legendary Golfer, Bobby Jones wanted to build a Golf Course. After teaming up with investment banker, Clifford Roberts, the pair found a 365 acre place near Augusta Georgia that was the former site of The Fruitlands Nurseries. Upon seeing the land Jones said ” It seems that this land had been laying here for years just waiting for someone to lay a golf course on it.” \n They purchased the site in 1931, and hired legendary designer Dr. Alister McKenzie to design the course with significant input from Bobby Jones. Construction was completed and formally opened for play in 1933. In an attempt to increase membership, Jones and Roberts decided to get a professional event at Augusta, and in 1934, the Masters tournament was born. Dr. McKenzie never lived long enough to see the first Masters. \n The tournament wasn’t originally called the Masters, and Bobby Jones didn’t want it to be named the Masters, but relented to the pressure, and in 1939 let the tournament be officially named The Masters. \n When I was a kid in the 50’s Major League Baseball was the National Pastime, and most of us didn’t have televisions, the only memories I have of golf was from the sports part of the black and white newsreels at the movies. The Masters always made the reels, but it wasn’t until the late 60’s that we were able to see the beauty of Augusta National in living color. \n In the early years of televising the Masters, they would only show selective holes, and because broadcasters would always say the Masters begins on Sunday at the 10th hole, most of us have more knowledge of the back nine than the front side. \n The demanding drive at 10 that plays from the top of the mountain and requires a draw to catch the huge down slope, to the massive green at the bottom of the mountain where the last two Masters were decided in extra holes. Named Camellia, the green is always bathed in shadows late in the afternoon when the ability to read a putt is paramount. \n Be sure to hit your drive at 11 to the right and stay away from the pond just to the left, ask Greg Norman about that pond, and the beginning of Amen Corner. Many a Green Jacket lies in Rae’s Creek and the area behind the par three 12th hole. \n The par five 13th and 15 are what defines the beauty of Augusta. The trees, the flowers and the two holes where you can win a Green Jacket if you hit a great tee shot. You can make an easy eagle on these two holes, or you can make a double bogey, but if you don’t at least get through them with birdie, you are losing ground to the field. \n The par three 16th hole has been the place to win the Masters. Just ask Arnold Palmer in 1960, and Tiger Woods in 2005(his last Masters Championship). When Nike paid Tiger Woods $40 Million Dollars to promote their brand, they got every dollar back when the impossible chip shot from the back of the green stopped for just an instant to show you the Swoosh, then gently dropped into the cup. \n Golf.com has put together an array of photos called “Augusta National from 4000 Feet” that begin in 1960, and include periods"}

{"question": "What product 'brand' from the Gamay is traditionally released the third Thursday of November each year?", "answers": ["beaujolais nouveau"], "context": "Gamay Wine InformationGamay Wine Information \n Gamay \n   Gamay Wine \n Gamay (Gamay Noir à Jus Blanc in full) is a grape variety that is most famous for producing the light, fruit-driven red wines of Beaujolais . While the variety offers fresh, red-fruit and candied aromas, it typically delivers little in the way of flavor concentration and body weight, giving light, simple wines. That said, some well-made examples can be deep and complex. \n In France, Gamay is planted in the Maconnais , Savoie and around Touraine , but its homeland is Beaujolais. It arrived there (most likely from Germany) in the 14th Century and initially received an unenthusiastic welcome. The ruling dukes of Burgundy even tried to outlaw the variety, distrustful of its unfamiliar taste and texture. Gamay was resigned to the granite-based soils in the hills just north of Lyon, a terroir that it was much better suited to anyway. \n Gamay Grapes \n Characteristically, Gamay displays flavors of red cherries and strawberries and – when vinified using the carbonic maceration method – boiled sweets and banana. This technique is most often employed for what is arguably the most famous expression of the grape:  Beaujolais Nouveau , a wine rushed to consumers on the third Thursday of the November immediately following harvest. These light, translucent wines were traditionally made for vineyard workers but in the 1970s and 1980s captured the imagination of wine marketers, who quickly made the wine's release each year into an occasion. Unfortunately, Beaujolais Nouveau is a less-than-sterling expression of the variety and Gamay suffers from a somewhat-tarnished reputation as a result. \n Happily, Gamay is currently experiencing a comeback of sorts in the form of some of Beaujolais' other wines, namely those from the 10 villages, or crus, that bear the Beaujolais name. The most famous of these are Moulin-a-Vent , Fleurie and Morgon , although Chiroubles, Julienas and Brouilly all make excellent examples as well. These are usually vinified traditionally and are often aged in oak; the best can age for up to 10 years. \n Outside Beaujolais, Gamay is taken most seriously in Switzerland , where it is often blended with Pinot Noir. There are a few examples from Canada, Italy and New Zealand, and the grape is important to the viticultural landscape of Croatia , Kosovo and Serbia . \n Until the early 2000s Gamay grown in California was the subject of some confusion and debate; wine in California previously labeled as Gamay was identified as Valdeguie (an uninspiring French variety), while wine labeled as Gamay Beaujolais was found to be a clone of Pinot Noir. Some true Gamay Noir à Jus Blanc is planted in California, with the best examples coming from cooler regions at higher altitudes. \n Synonyms include: Gamay Noir, Gamay Noir à Jus Blanc. \n Food matches for Gamay include: \n Roast turkey with cranberry sauce \n Grilled salmon fillet with roasted fennel \n Moroccan lamb tagine with apricot \n Last updated 30-Nov-2015  Beaujolais Nouveau | Temecula Valley Winegrowers AssociationBeaujolais Nouveau | Temecula Valley Winegrowers Association \n Winermaker’s Roundtable: Five Facts About…Beaujolais Nouveau, + Baily Winery To Release 2011 Cabernet Nouveau \n Friday, November 11th, 2011 \n November 17th marks the third Thursday in November, which is Beaujolais Nouveau Day all around the world. Here’s five facts you may or may have not known about this young wine: \n Beaujolais is a red wine made from Gamay grapes- the only grape permitted for this wine- in the Beaujolais region, south of Burgundy, in France. \n Beaujolais Nouveau is the new vintage, usually fermented for just six weeks before shipping. \n It is generally recommended that Beaujolais Nouveau be drunk no later than the following May after its release, although certain vintages that are considered to be excellent (2009, for example) can be saved much longer. \n It is mandated that all of the grapes in the Beaujolais region be picked by hand. \n This wine is always released on the third Thursday in November no matter how short the harvest. \n Speaking of “nouveau,” Baily Vineyard & Winery celebrates 25 years of producing wine with the release of its 2011 Cabernet Nouveau on"}

At about 180 MBP, in the Jurassic Period, the two plates reversed direction and began to compress the Tethys floor, causing it to be subducted under Eurasia and pushing up the edge of the latter plate in the Alpine Orogeny of the Oligocene and Miocene Periods. Several microplates were caught in the squeeze and rotated or were pushed laterally, generating the individual features of Mediterranean geography: Iberia pushed up the Pyrenees; Italy, the Alps, and Anatolia, moving west, the mountains of Greece and the islands.

{"question": "What do young Ctenophores generaly look like?", "answers": ["miniature cydippids", "miniature cydippids", "miniature cydippids"], "context": "Most species are hermaphrodites—a single animal can produce both eggs and sperm, meaning it can fertilize its own egg, not needing a mate. Some are simultaneous hermaphrodites, which can produce both eggs and sperm at the same time. Others are sequential hermaphrodites, in which the eggs and sperm mature at different times. Fertilization is generally external, although platyctenids' eggs are fertilized inside their parents' bodies and kept there until they hatch. The young are generally planktonic and in most species look like miniature cydippids, gradually changing into their adult shapes as they grow. The exceptions are the beroids, whose young are miniature beroids with large mouths and no tentacles, and the platyctenids, whose young live as cydippid-like plankton until they reach near-adult size, but then sink to the bottom and rapidly metamorphose into the adult form. In at least some species, juveniles are capable of reproduction before reaching the adult size and shape. The combination of hermaphroditism and early reproduction enables small populations to grow at an explosive rate."}

{"question": "Which provinces in Canada limit the rights of pharmacists in prescribing?", "answers": ["Alberta and British Columbia", "Alberta and British Columbia", "Alberta and British Columbia"], "context": "This shift has already commenced in some countries; for instance, pharmacists in Australia receive remuneration from the Australian Government for conducting comprehensive Home Medicines Reviews. In Canada, pharmacists in certain provinces have limited prescribing rights (as in Alberta and British Columbia) or are remunerated by their provincial government for expanded services such as medications reviews (Medschecks in Ontario). In the United Kingdom, pharmacists who undertake additional training are obtaining prescribing rights and this is because of pharmacy education. They are also being paid for by the government for medicine use reviews. In Scotland the pharmacist can write prescriptions for Scottish registered patients of their regular medications, for the majority of drugs, except for controlled drugs, when the patient is unable to see their doctor, as could happen if they are away from home or the doctor is unavailable. In the United States, pharmaceutical care or clinical pharmacy has had an evolving influence on the practice of pharmacy. Moreover, the Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm. D.) degree is now required before entering practice and some pharmacists now complete one or two years of residency or fellowship training following graduation. In addition, consultant pharmacists, who traditionally operated primarily in nursing homes are now expanding into direct consultation with patients, under the banner of \"senior care pharmacy.\""}

Lifschitz said he was released a few hours after being abducted. He was treated for injuries in a hospital.\n\n\n\n\"They told me that I wouldn't die unless they wanted me to,\" he said Sunday.\n\n\n\nLifschitz, who has also worked as a lawyer for Argentine Federal Police, is the former legal secretary for Judge Juan Jose Galeano, who headed the investigation into local connections to the AMIA bombing until he was removed from the case.\n\n\n\nLifschitz has testified that Galeano mishandled the investigation, including allegedly making a $400,000 bribe to a key witness. Galeano was taken off the AMIA investigation in 2003 and was removed from his position as a judge in 2005.\n\n\n\nThe investigation in the AMIA bombing has dragged on for nearly 15 years, with no indictments and a series of accusations of cover-ups and corruption.\n\n\n\nArgentina, Israel and the United States have blamed the Mideast-based Hezbollah terrorist organization for the attack.\n\n\n\nIn March 2007, Interpol issued arrest warrants for five Iranian officials and a Lebanese national in connection with the bombing. Tehran has repeatedly denied any involvement.\n\n\n\nFormer Argentine President Carlos Menem also has been investigated to see whether he was involved in a cover-up.\n\n\n\nMenem appeared in federal court Monday on an issue related to the AMIA attack investigation but declined to testify. He did submit a written statement denying that he had any involvement in a cover-up.\n\n\n\nLifschitz said his alleged abductors were interested in the possible Iranian connection.\n\n\n\n\"They started to ask about information about the SIDE (State Intelligence Secretariat) related to the AMIA attack,\" Lifschitz told CNN.\n\n\n\n\"And then they asked me about cassettes of conversations between the Iranians. That shows that the SIDE doesn't deny that they had intercepted some phone lines with the help of some judges.\n\n\n\n\"They were afraid that I had copies of these tapes and I would present them to a judge, but I told them that I don't have any copies of the tapes.\"\n\n\n\nLifschitz, who said he is a non-practicing Jew, also told CNN the men were interested in his religion.\n\n\n\n\"I always wear a rosary around my neck, and they grabbed me by the neck and said, 'Why are you wearing this if you're a Jew?'\"\n\n\n\nIn addition to the AMIA attack, a similar deadly anti-Semitic terrorist attack took place on March 17, 1992, when 29 people died and more"}

The \"Alice and Jerry\" series followed patterns similar to the Dick and Jane readers, which are now better known in the United States.  \n The sentences in the \"Alice and Jerry\" readers were short, and used repeating words to build reader's stamina and familiarity. For instance, here is the text from the book \"Skip Along\": \"One, two three. Come and see. Come and see. See my umbrella. Look, Jerry. Up. // One, two three. Come and see. Come and see.

Nearly all the books were written by Mabel O'Donnell, who also wrote an Anglicisation of the series, named Janet and John.   \n O'Donnell was a teacher, supervisor and curriculum coordinator for elementary schools in East Aurora Public School District 131. Most of the books were illustrated by Florence and Margaret Hoopes. \n Both series were widely used in the United States and other English-speaking countries. The books were often sold as a set that a classroom might use for a reading curriculum."}

{"question": "What did the Ford expert say?", "answers": ["\"The extensive use of advanced technologies and materials in the 2009 F-150 required us to develop new, specific procedures and repair recommendations,\" said Gerry Bonanni,"], "context": "(AOL Autos) -- Have you ever heard of someone having their car \"totaled\"? While the word might conjure images of a massive car accident, replete with broken glass and the Jaws of Life, the reality is sometimes far removed.\n\n\n\nFord's repair and safety engineers first began collaborating on the 2009 F-150 pick-up truck.\n\n\n\nIn fact, there are many accidents that produce structural damage such that the vehicle's frame is bent, even though the exterior of the car might even look drivable.\n\n\n\nTypically these cars are \"totaled,\" which might give buyers the peace of mind knowing they will get a replacement vehicle. But, overall this produces much higher insurance rates for all drivers.\n\n\n\nCar companies and insurers are working hard to try and reduce the cost of auto repairs and insurance premiums for consumers and some of the development is breathtaking in its innovation\n\n\n\nThis effort has already led to many new developments in the design of various auto parts and components -- which have indeed led to a reduction in repair costs for various auto parts, components and structures.\n\n\n\nAnd more advances are on the way: some carmakers have recently ramped up their operations in this area, which should result in greater cost savings in coming years.\n\n\n\nOne recent development in this area is the Ford Motor Company's new $650,000 Paint and Body Technology Center in Inkster, Michigan, about 20 minutes from the company's Dearborn world headquarters. The new center was created by merging operations with the company's Safety Crash Test Analysis department.\n\n\n\nOther car companies have their own versions of this kind of operation, including Ford's crosstown rivals, General Motors Corp. and Chrysler LLC.\n\n\n\nThe new Ford center represents an advancement over its previous paint and body tech operation in that it's larger, closer to the company's HQ, and now works more closely with design engineers and auto insurers -- and gets insurers involved earlier in the design process. AOL Autos: Cut your insurance in half\n\n\n\nThe goal is to identify potential repair issues and then use that info to refine designs -- which in turn helps cut the cost of repairs at dealerships and independent repair shops. Plus, this effort allows repair techs to more effectively restore the vehicles to their pre-accident condition.\n\n\n\nTo that end, engineers gather data earlier in the vehicle development process so it can be then analyzed during crash and durability testing. AOL Autos: How to choose a repair shop\n\n\n\nFor Ford, the closer integration of these functions began when the carmaker's repair and safety engineers first began collaborating on the 2009 F-150 pick-up truck.\n\n\n\nDuring the vehicle's early development period, these engineers realized that new materials -- including ultra-high-strength steel and boron -- helped make the new truck safer, but also could make it more expensive to repair after a collision. AOL Autos: Minor damages, major repair costs\n\n\n\n\"The extensive use of advanced technologies and materials in the 2009 F-150 required us to develop new, specific procedures and repair recommendations,\" said Gerry Bonanni, Ford's collision repair senior engineer.\n\n\n\nSo, Ford engineers designed and developed new front and rear-frame-section kits -- which means one single section of the frame can now be repaired / replaced after a crash, instead of having to replace the entire frame.\n\n\n\n\"Partial-frame repairs cost at least $2,000 less than full-frame replacements,\" says Bonanni -- and will prevent some vehicles from being \"totaled,\" which would have previously been the case under repair laws in some states.\n\n\n\nThe success of the collaboration on the F-150 prompted the decision to open the new paint and body tech center. A more recent example was the work done on the 2010 Mustang.\n\n\n\n\"Previously, we had no real procedure for sectioning off the rear-frame rails,\" says Bonanni. \"But, by collaborating with repair technicians and the insurance companies, we developed a procedure, which we then documented for the repair techs in our dealers.\n\n\n\n\"That allows them to repair just a short section of the rear-frame rails, instead of replacing the entire frame-rail system"}

{"question": "What measurement of time is used in polynomial time reduction?", "answers": ["polynomial time", "polynomial", "polynomial time"], "context": "The most commonly used reduction is a polynomial-time reduction. This means that the reduction process takes polynomial time. For example, the problem of squaring an integer can be reduced to the problem of multiplying two integers. This means an algorithm for multiplying two integers can be used to square an integer. Indeed, this can be done by giving the same input to both inputs of the multiplication algorithm.

{"question": "Which BBC TV sitcom about a retired security guard was set at 37 Wyngate Drive in the first series then at 19, Riverbank for the final 5 series?", "answers": ["meldrew"], "context": "Victor MeldrewVictor Meldrew is a fictional character in the BBC One sitcom One Foot in the Grave, created by David Renwick and portrayed by Richard Wilson. The character epitomised the archetypal grumpy old man. Meldrew is a foil for the bothersome aspects of children, cars, animals, power cuts and next-door neighbours (his particular example being Patrick Trench, played by Angus Deayton). The character was created specifically for Wilson, with whom Renwick had worked on the series Hot Metal, though Wilson initially turned the part down as at 53, he felt he was too young to play the 60-year-old Meldrew. Renwick considered Les Dawson for the part before Wilson changed his mind.  \n __TOC__ \n Character  \n In the first episode, the cantankerous Meldrew, aged 60, is forced into retirement as a security guard (which he describes as \"being replaced by a box\"). The series follows Meldrew as he tries to fill his new-found leisure with odd jobs and unusual idiosyncrasies, or to get a new job. However, he regularly finds himself mistreated, misunderstood or simply the victim of bad luck, which leads to his complaining heartily. \n The pensioner is most famous for his catchphrase, \"I don't believe it!!\", an expression of discontent which was actually used fairly infrequently. Quite often, he stops short at \"I don't ...\". According to Wilson, this is because series creator Renwick wanted to avoid overusing it.. Other frequently used expressions of exasperation are \"Unbe-lieeeve-able!\", \"What in the name of bloody hell?!\" and \"In the name of sanity!\" Victor is something of a hypochondriac, keeping a medical book with him to look up every ailment he believes has befallen him. (Margaret describes it as \"browsing through to see what he can die of next\".) \n The series was so successful that in the UK the term a Victor Meldrew has become a euphemism for a bitter and complaining elderly man. However, both Renwick and Wilson himself have disagreed that Victor is an example of this stereotype; Wilson himself once said in an interview that he was a \"normal man in a world full of idiots\", and he is shown to be more of a tragicomedy character, not bitter and grumpy by nature, but driven to it due to his habit of attracting trouble. Renwick once pointed out in an interview that the name \"Victor\" is ironic, since he almost always ends up as the loser.  \n Although he is seen as misanthropic by the many victims of his wrath and misfortune, Victor is often depicted as an honest, likeable and sympathetic character. Ultimately, many felt that the things that he railed against, e.g. yobbish behaviour, lack of consideration for others, shoddy service, and bureaucratic indifference, were things that he had every right to get angry about. In fact, if anything, most admired him for having the guts to stand up and be counted, as the bizarre misfortunes that befell Meldrew would be enough to exasperate anyone. In the episode \"Warm Champagne\", his long-suffering wife Margaret defends him. When Margaret contemplates having an affair with Ben, a man she meets on holiday, Ben puts Victor down and accuses him of being insensitive. Margaret replies that Victor is in fact the most sensitive person she's ever met. If he weren't so sensitive, he wouldn't be upset by the smallest of things, and that is the reason she loves him (and \"continually wants to ram his head through a television screen\"). In \"Descent into the Maelstrom\", Margaret is visited by a woman she used to care for as a child, but Victor discovered that she was in fact mentally unstable, sought by the police for kidnapping a toddler, and had stolen a pair of earrings Margaret treasured. Victor turned the woman over to the authorities and chose not to tell Margaret, preferring to let her think he had lost the earrings, knowing how much the truth would upset her. In the episode \"Hearts of Darkness\", Victor chanced"}

{"question": "When will the glaciers melt?", "answers": ["as soon as 2050,"], "context": "(CNN) -- Scientists expect some great travel spots to be altered or ruined by global climate change.\n\nGlaciers in the European Alps may melt as soon as 2050, some scientists say.\n\nSome of the changes are already taking place. Others are expected to be seen in coming decades.\n\nThere are two ways to look at this: Either stay home (which might be less depressing and won't add more airline emissions) or get a move on it and see the hot spots you just can't miss.\n\nFor those who want to head out, CNN got advice on the best pre-warming travel destinations from Bob Henson, author of \"The Rough Guide to Climate Change\" and a writer at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado.\n\nHere are Henson's top five choices:\n\nGreat Barrier Reef, Australia\n\nWarming temperatures can spell disaster for coral reefs, which depend on a delicate balance of ocean temperature and chemistry to bloom into colorful displays.\n\nMany of the world's reefs already are experiencing \"bleaching\" in which algae living in the coral die and leave behind whitened skeletons.\n\nThe Great Barrier Reef -- which is composed of about 2,900 individual reefs and is off the northeast coast of Australia -- is seeing limited bleaching now, and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority expects the problem to grow in coming decades.\n\nHenson said the reefs' colorful displays are not to be missed.\n\n\"It's a feast for the eyes in terms of color, texture variations -- it's just amazing to see,\" he said. \"It's wonderful to be enveloped in the warm water and look down just a few feet below at this amazing spread of ocean life.\"\n\nBoats of people with snorkels typically launch into the reefs from Cairns, Queensland. If you go, tread lightly, Henson said. Visitors can damage the reefs if they get too close.\n\nNew Orleans, Louisiana\n\nHow much sea levels will rise as the world warms is one of the trickiest parts of the climate change equation. If huge hunks of ice -- such as parts of Greenland and the western shelf of Antarctica -- melt, then the rise is expected to be more dramatic.\n\n\"Nobody knows whether they're going to completely melt or not, but we do know it's not going to happen in the next 10 years,\" Henson said.\n\nBut for cities near the coast such as New Orleans, which already sits below sea level, rising waters could spell trouble for tourists and residents alike, even in the relative near term.\n\n\"In the next several hundred years, life there may be difficult, and the cities may become impractical unless we can build large structures to keep the waters at bay,\" he said.\n\nHenson doesn't expect New Orleans to be underwater anytime soon. But travel to the Louisiana city may become more difficult in the future, he said. Scientists expect floods to become more frequent.\n\n\"It's sobering to be in New Orleans and look up at the levees that sit above you and keep out the Mississippi River,\" he said. \"You're standing below the level of the river, looking up.\"\n\nRocky Mountain National Park, Estes Park, Colorado\n\nHerds of tiny pine beetles are munching away at Colorado's forests, turning the evergreens a sickly red and destroying large patches of trees.\n\nCold snaps -- which, in mountain terms, mean about five nights of minus-30 temperatures -- usually kill off the native beetles. But winters are warming, and Henson and others said they worry the beetles can't be stopped.\n\nThe beetle infestation \"has reached epidemic proportions as a result of climate issues,\" said Kyle Patterson, spokeswoman for the Rocky Mountain National Park.\n\nThe beetles are causing problems all over America's mountainous west, but the issue is particularly visible at Patterson's park, northwest of Denver. Henson recommends visiting the park this decade to ensure you can still see the dense forests in decent shape. Some of the reddened forests look beautiful in a strange way, Henson said, but visitors should note"}

{"question": "What is the Irish term for private schools?", "answers": ["scoil phríobháideach", "scoil phríobháideach", "scoil phríobháideach"], "context": "In Ireland, private schools (Irish: scoil phríobháideach) are unusual because a certain number of teacher's salaries are paid by the State. If the school wishes to employ extra teachers they are paid for with school fees, which tend to be relatively low in Ireland compared to the rest of the world. There is, however, a limited element of state assessment of private schools, because of the requirement that the state ensure that children receive a certain minimum education; Irish private schools must still work towards the Junior Certificate and the Leaving Certificate, for example. Many private schools in Ireland also double as boarding schools. The average fee is around €5,000 annually for most schools, but some of these schools also provide boarding and the fees may then rise up to €25,000 per year. The fee-paying schools are usually run by a religious order, i.e., the Society of Jesus or Congregation of Christian Brothers, etc."}
